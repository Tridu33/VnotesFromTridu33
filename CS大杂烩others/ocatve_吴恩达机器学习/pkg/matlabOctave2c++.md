# 1. matlabOctave2c++

Since you are converting from Octave code, it makes a lot of sense to use Octave's C++ library. They can see its [doxygen docs](http://octave.sourceforge.net/doxygen/html/index.html) online.





























# 2. C2MATLAB
Using [Universal-transpiler](https://jarble.github.io/transpiler/javascript/js_transpiler/test_parser.html#%7B%22inputText%22%3A%22%5Cndouble%20distance_formula(double%20x1%2Cdouble%20y1%2Cdouble%20x2%2Cdouble%20y2)%7B%5Cn%20%20%20%20return%20sqrt(pow(x1-x2%2C2)%2Bpow(xy-y2%2C2))%3B%5Cn%7D%22%2C%22inputLang%22%3A%22c%2B%2B%22%2C%22outputLang%22%3A%22matlab%22%7D), it is possible to convert a very limited subset of C++ into equivalent Matlab code.
