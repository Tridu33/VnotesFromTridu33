看起来Z3现在已经内置了对传递闭包的支持

3.8. Transitive Closure

The transitive closure of a relation is a property that cannot be fully axiomatized using first-order formalisms. Quantifier-free formulas using the transitive closure of relations remain decidable, however, using a finite model construction. Given a relation binary R, the transitive closure of R is another relation TC_R that relates two elements by if there is a non-empty path that connect them through R. To create a transitive closure or transitive reflexive closure of R.

```z3
  R = Function('R', A, A, B)
  TC_R = TransitiveClosure(R)
  s = Solver()
  a, b, c = Consts('a b c', A)
  s.add(R(a, b))
  s.add(R(b, c))
  s.add(Not(TC_R(a, c)))
  print(s.check())   # produces unsat
```


R是AXA -> B的函数（A, B都是类型吧）， 声明R是传递闭包，记作TC_R，如果R(a, b)和 R(b,c )成立，那么TC_R(a,c)也必然成立
