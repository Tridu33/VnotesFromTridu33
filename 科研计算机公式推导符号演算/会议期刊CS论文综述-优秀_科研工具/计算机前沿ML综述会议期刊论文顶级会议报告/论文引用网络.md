The Web of Science Core Collection is a citation index.  A citation index is a way of organizing and representing the literature using cited references.  When authors cite one another, they show us connections between published papers, and therefore connections between the ideas those papers represent.  An author implies a subject relationship to a paper when they cite it.

The Citation Network is represented for each paper through:

**Cites References** – the backward references - the research that this paper cites, and its discoveries were based upon.  
**Times Cited** – the forward citations – more recently published papers that cite this one.  
**Related Records** – papers which share at least one cited reference in common with this paper.  If they share citations, they’re likely discussing similar topics.
