Unfortunately no, this does not exist yet. I too have been looking at this space. It seems to be in the works mentioned here on their wiki - Semantic-Parsing

If you are interested in other languages / frameworks, take a peek at [Semantic Parsing with Execution, Stanford](https://github.com/percyliang/sempre) or [The University of Washington Semantic Parsing Framework](https://bitbucket.org/yoavartzi/spf).

If you want to build something from the ground up, you might want to obtain the CCGBank or revive C&C Tools.

Most of the above is in Java, but I have seen [attempts to parse the C&C Marked file in Python](http://github.com/syllog1sm/ccg).

I personally would like to see CCG come to Node.js.
