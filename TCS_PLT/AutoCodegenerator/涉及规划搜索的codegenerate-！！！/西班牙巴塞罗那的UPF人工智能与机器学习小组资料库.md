Automated Programming Framework
The Automated Programming Framework includes the code necessary to configure and execute different compilations related to the formalisms of Planning Programs and Hierarchical Finite State Controllers. These compilations are produced from the original planning problems using the Universal PDDL Parser, and solved using classical planners which are included in the repository.
