Tarski is a framework for the specification, modeling and manipulation of 
[AI planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling) problems.
Tarski is written in Python and includes parsers for major modeling languages
(e.g., [PDDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language),
[FSTRIPS](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=566359),
[RDDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language#RDDL)), 
along with modules to perform other common tasks such as logical transformations,
reachability analysis, grounding of first-order representations and problem reformulations.
