# GraphQL Code Generator








GraphQL Code Generator is a CLI tool that can generate TypeScript typings out of a GraphQL schema. When we develop a GraphQL backend, there would be many instances where we would find ourselves writing the same things which are already described by the GraphQL schema, only in a different format; for example: resolver signatures, MongoDB models, Angular services etc.


模板从DSL简化到详细补充点语法杂音格式的code,比较基于模板生成而不是转换器
