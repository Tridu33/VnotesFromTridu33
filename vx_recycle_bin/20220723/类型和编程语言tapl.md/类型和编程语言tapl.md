- CIS 500, Software Foundations 

  https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis500/current/index.html

  University of Pennsylvania. First-year graduate course, required for all computer science MSE and PhD students.

  The 2007 offering of the course is completely formalized in Coq, but doesn't cover as much of TAPL as earlier offerings.

- [CS101, Programming Languages ](http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~jyh/classes/cs101/index.html), Cal Tech. Introductory undergraduate/graduate level course, with a bias toward interpreting type systems using intuitionistic logic.

- A [course at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~frank/FST/index.htm) based on TAPL but with examples in Scala.
