# 1. core.logic


https://github.com/clojure/core.logic



A logic programming library for Clojure & ClojureScript. core.logic offers Prolog-like relational programming, constraint logic programming, and nominal logic programming for Clojure. 

At its heart is an original implementation of **miniKanren** as described in William Byrd's dissertation Relational Programming in miniKanren: Techniques, Applications, and Implementations as well as the extensions described in cKanren and Î±Kanren. It is designed to be easily extended to forms of logic programming beyond the ones provided.
