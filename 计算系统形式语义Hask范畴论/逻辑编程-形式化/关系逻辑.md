# 1. 关系逻辑

[standford课程介绍关系逻辑](http://logic.stanford.edu/intrologic/chapters/chapter_06.html#:~:text=In%20Relational%20Logic%2C%20the%20precedence,both%20quantifiers%20and%20logical%20operators)






[Automating First-Order Relational Logic](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/sdg/pubs/2000/alcoa-algorithm.pdf)文中提到 Relational  logic  adds  to  first-order  logic  the  ability  to  combine  predicates  with  special  operators.  For  example,  we  can  write  the  formula $∀x,y. S(x)∧R(x,y)⇒ T(y) $as S.R in T, where S.R denotes the image  of  the  set  S  under  the  relation  R.  The  logic  is  more  than  a  definitional  extension  of  first-order  logic,  because  it  includes  transitive closure.
