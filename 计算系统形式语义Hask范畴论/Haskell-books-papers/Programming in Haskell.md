Description
Haskell is a purely functional language that allows programmers to rapidly develop software that is clear, concise and correct. This book is based on the author's experience of teaching Haskell for more than twenty years. All concepts are explained from first principles and no programming experience is required, making the book accessible to a broad spectrum of readers.

Part I introduces the basic concepts of pure programming in Haskell and is structured around the core features of the language. Part II covers impure programming and a range of more advanced topics. The book contains many extended programming examples, and each chapter includes a series of exercises and suggestions for further reading.

This new edition has been extensively updated and expanded to include recent and more advanced features of Haskell, new examples and exercises, selected solutions, and freely downloadable lecture slides and example code. The presentation is clean and simple, while also being fully compliant with the latest version of the language, including recent changes concerning applicative, monadic, foldable and traversable types.

Graham Hutton is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. He has taught Haskell to thousands of students and received many awards for his teaching. Hutton has served as an editor of the Journal of Functional Programming, Chair of the Haskell Symposium and the International Conference on Functional Programming, Vice-Chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages, and he is an ACM Distinguished Scientist.
