基于Raúl Rojas卓越的Tutorial Introduction to the Lambda Calculus




在一定的精度内，通过描述个体神经元之间的联系的强度和，神经元的激励值，还有在极段时间内刺激的传播，λ演算同样也可以被用于神经网络。理论上，任何管理信息的可行系统都是可以计算的，任何可以用λ演算描述的可计算系统（或者可以用其他方式描述λ演算）都是电脑。


Conversely, it is possible to map any Lambda expression onto a tape, and construct a Turing Machine that performs all the necessary find/replace operations on it. Thus, it can be proven that Lambda Calculus and Turing Machine have exactly the same power. In the same way, it can be shown that every other computer we can (or could) construct has the same power, too. This includes personal computers, super-computers, quantum computers and even iPhones. The only differences are in practically realized memory sizes, and the number of steps necessary to reach a result. The insight that all computers have fundamentally the same power is called the *“Church Turing Thesis”*.

The Lambda Calculus can also be used to compute neural networks with arbitrary accuracy, by expressing the strengths of the connections between individual neurons, and the activation values of the neurons as numbers, and by calculating the spreading of activation through the network in very small time steps. Technically, every realizable system that manipulates information is computable, and every computable system that can express the Lambda Calculus (or something else that can express the Lambda Calculus) is a computer.
