```
C:\Users\admin>cabal v1-install Euterpea
Resolving dependencies...
All the requested packages are already installed:
Euterpea-2.0.7
Use --reinstall if you want to reinstall anyway.

```








Warning: The update command is a part of the legacy v1 style of cabal usage.

Please switch to using either the new project style and the new-update command
or the legacy v1-update alias as new-style projects will become the default in
the next version of cabal-install. Please file a bug if you cannot replicate a
working v1- use case with the new-style commands.
