**Search**
-  Uninformed Search

DFS deepth-first search深度优先
BFS breadth-first search
Uniform-cost search 一致代价搜索
informed Search有信息搜索（给知识引导更有效找到解）对比   uninformed 
Depth-limited search 深度有限搜索
Iterative-Deepening search迭代加深的深度优先搜索
Bidirectional search双向搜索


-  Informed(Heuristic启发式) Search无信息（除了问题定义本身外没其他信息）的搜索
贪心
A*算法：缩小总评价代价 https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html


-  Adversarial Search对抗搜索
-  Constraint Satisfaction Problems(CSPs)约束满足问题
Backtracking回溯 Search for CSPs 
Forward Checking (FC) 前向检查
Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC)广义弧一致性 拓扑排序


-  Typical Problems ：maze,puzzle,8 queens puzzle,Sudoku,Othello,Tic Tac Toe

**Prolog**
-  Typical Problems :Search Problems KR(e.g. Family Problem)、Queries on KB(Similar to SQL)、CSPs、 Sudoku Problem、Eight Queens Problem、Other Games
