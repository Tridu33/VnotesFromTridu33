# nlab

The **purpose of the nLab** is to provide a public place where people can make notes about stuff. The purpose is not to make polished expositions of material; that is a happy by-product.

We all make notes as we read papers, read books and doodle on pads of paper. The nLab is somewhere to put all those notes, and, incidentally, to make them available to others. Others might read them and add or polish them. But even if they don’t, it is still easier to link from them to other notes that you’ve made.

个人来感觉nLab对一些比较小分支的介绍比wikipedia全面，或者可以说是research level的wiki...但就像nLab介绍里说的那样，本质上其实是大牛们记笔记讨论杂耍的一个平台..

nLab 呀，强烈推荐，良心物理学习网站，真正的物理，哪里不会点哪里，几乎完全 self-contain，适合初学者
