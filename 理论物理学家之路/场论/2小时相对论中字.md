 hello today I'm going to try to derive  the Einstein field equations this will  be a basic introduction it won't be  rigorous it will cover the essence but  it will still be quite complex if you  want more detail then I refer you to  Professor Leonard Susskind excellent  lectures that he gave from October to  December 2008 at Stanford I've put a  link to the YouTube version of these  lectures in an annotation on this video  I am going to follow his approach so  that it will be familiar to you but I  shall do it in a much more simplified  version and let's always remember that  it took Einstein ten years to develop  these equations and he had access to  many maths professors on the way as  usual I'm making the assumption that you  understand calculus and basic geometry  and that you've also seen or are aware  of the information in my general  relativity videos that are already up on  YouTube and in particular that you are  aware of two key points the first is  what is called the principle of  equivalence and what that says is that  if you are in a box with no windows then  you can't tell the difference between  being in outer space and accelerating  with an acceleration G or being in the  same box on the surface of the earth  stationary but subject to the  gravitational force which carries an  acceleration G there is no experiment  let's put you in the box  there is no experiment that you can do  that will distinguish between those two  situations now that is actually not  quite true the difference of course is  that if you are in outer space traveling  with an acceleration G then all parts of  this box including you are accelerating  at the acceleration G if you are on  earth then because the value of G varies  according to the height above the earth  the value of G at this  point will be ever so slightly greater  than the value of G at this point and so  there is a slight difference in the  value of G in this situation and if you  can measure that then you can tell the  difference that difference is called the  tidal force but apart from that Einstein  said that that was a principle of  equivalence you can't tell the  difference whether you are accelerating  at GE or subject to a gravitational  force which is represented by the  acceleration G the second principle is  that light bends in a gravitational  field this was Einstein's reasoning if  you take the person who is in the box  that is accelerating through space with  an acceleration G and here is the box  and this time we're going to shine a  light from this side of the box to the  other side of the box but of course that  will take a finite time albeit small and  if this box is accelerating with an  acceleration G by the time the light  gets halfway across the box will have  accelerated a little bit further forward  so it will now be here which means the  light will have reached that position  there by the time the light gets to the  right hand side the box will of course  have accelerated still further and now  the light which of course is just going  in a straight line will reach here so if  you look at it it appears within the box  that the light has gone from here to a  point lower down to a point even lower  down in other words the overall  impression is that the light has gone  from here to here to here and that's a  curve at least it should be if I've  drawn it properly so Einstein says if  that is what happens when you are  accelerating through space with  acceleration G since the principal the  equivalent says you  can't tell the difference between that  and being stationary on earth subject to  an acceleration G then the same thing  should happen in this scenario here that  light will appear to bend in a  gravitational field now of course he  could have been wrong but in fact this  was shown to be true during a solar  eclipse what happens during a solar  eclipse is that the moon essentially  blocks the Sun said that from the earth  the Sun as it were is blotted out and  what was noted from the position on  earth was that they could see a star  just slightly to the right of the Sun  but they knew astronomers knew that that  star actually was located behind the Sun  and it shouldn't have been possible to  see it and the explanation was that what  was actually happening was that light  from That star was being bent in the  gravitational field of the Sun and then  coming to us on earth giving the  impression that the star was here when  in fact the star was really here but the  light was being bent in the Sun's  gravitational field now here was the  problem for Einstein Newton's law of  gravitation which everybody had thought  had served as well for so long  says that the gravitational force is  equal to the gravitational constant  times the mass of one body multiplied by  the mass of another body divided by the  distance between them R squared or  divided by the distance squared and  that's fine  except that in this situation here light  is bending in a gravitational field but  photons of light have no mass so these  two mass terms were at least the Sun has  an S but the photon doesn't so this form  of Newton's law doesn't work if it is  going to apply to light five photons  have  no maths so Einstein came up with a  completely different approach to gravity  instead of there being gravity he said  actually what is happening is that all  forms of motion are represented by  movement in curved space-time and I can  illustrate that in this way let's  suppose that we take a trampoline this  is the surface of the trampoline and  that's representing space-time and we  put a small nut marble on that  trampoline the marble will have  virtually no effect it might make a very  tiny indentation on the trampoline but  now let's suppose I get on the  trampoline if I get on the trampoline  with my weight the trampoline is going  to bend quite substantially and that is  the equivalent of bent space-time or  curved space-time what's going to happen  to this marble  well the marble is now going to fall  towards me the analogy is not brilliant  but it'll do for our purposes now Newton  said that that movement towards me was  caused by gravitational attraction  Einstein on the other hand says no what  is happening is the marble is moving  along the shortest path in curved  space-time so that when the earth goes  around the Sun there's the Sun and  here's the earth in a reasonable  circular orbit going around the Sun  Newton says that there's a gravitational  force between the Sun and the earth  which provides the centripetal force  that keeps the earth in orbit Einstein  says no that's not it at all  what happens is the Sun being massive  curves space-time and the earth is  simply going round that curve in a  straight line in curved space-time now  you might be wondering two things  firstly what is space-time  secondly why did Einstein think that it  would be curved  well space-time is really just space and  time all thought of as one set of  coordinates we usually think of space as  having three dimensions which we  represent by three what are called  orthogonal axes they are at right angles  to one another so we normally have the x  axis the y axis and the z axis or if you  like we have three dimensions in space  up and down back and forth and side to  side if you add a time dimension to that  you get four-dimensional space-time  problem with four-dimensional spacetime  is it's very difficult to draw because  we can only conceive three dimensions so  I'm going to cheat and I'm going to draw  one dimension of time and one dimension  of space which is the x axis I could've  caused or another dimension this way but  I'll just leave it as one dimension of  time and one dimension of space now if  you draw a constant velocity in  space-time you get a straight line  because a straight line is distance  divided by time it's a constant distance  divided by a constant time and that is a  constant velocity but if you accelerate  in space-time you get a curve the reason  of course being that acceleration means  that the longer the time the further you  go so there is a curve in the  acceleration and because gravity causes  acceleration it causes a graph which is  curved in these space-time coordinates  and Einstein's view was that therefore  in some way space-time must be curved if  it is creating an acceleration which has  the effect of creating a curve in those  space-time coordinates well that's the  end of the introduction so now it's time  to introduce you to the einstein field  equations that  we're killing to try to derive and there  they are you may observe that there is  only one equation but in fact that's not  true because you will notice that there  are some indices mu and nu which arrive  arise in several places in the equations  now mu and nu represent the dimensions  of space-time not one two and three  naught is time one is the x axis two is  the y axis and z is the sorry three is  the z axis so mu and nu can each take  four values between naught and 3 and the  combination of mu and nu means that  there are 16 variations of this equation  with mu and nu having numbers between  naught and 3 you might therefore think  that there are 16 equations in  four-dimensional space-time but in fact  6 of them are duplicates so in fact it  reduces to 10 so you are looking at 10  Einstein field equations now what all  these hieroglyphics mean will you'll be  pleased to know that some of them you  already know you will know what 1/2 is  you know what 8 is you know what PI is G  is the good old fashioned gravitational  constant and C is the speed of light so  there are only a few things that we need  to sort out first we've got this  peculiar term R mu nu which is called  the Ricci curvature tensor will derive  that they need two places we've got this  term G mu nu G mu nu is the metric  tensor will derive that then we have R  but with no indices that's called the  curvature scalar and we'll show what  that is then we've got capital lambda  which turns out to be the cosmological  constant and we'll explain the reason  for that and finally we've got T mu nu  which is the stress energy momentum  tensor  and we'll try to explain what that is  now the whole point about this equation  is that it balances two things  everything on the left-hand side refers  to curvature of space-time everything on  the right-hand side is to do with mass  and energy and as some people have some  sometimes helpfully said that what  Einstein field equations basically say  is that mass tells space-time how to  curve and curved space-time tells más  how to move so here's our agenda for the  remainder of this video we've done the  introduction next we shall do metric  tensors then we'll move on to  Christoffel symbols which are capital  gamma terms you may wonder why I need to  do that because they don't appear to  feature in the Einstein field equation  but they are heavily involved in the  Ricci curvature tensor so we'll need the  Christoffel symbol then we'll look at  curvature itself which will enable us to  derive the Ricci curvature tensor and  the curvature scalar then we'll look at  the stress energy momentum tensor and  then the cosmological constant and  finally we'll put it all together you  may want to take a break through this  video just to collect your thoughts  indeed before we move on to the next  section you might fancy a break now okay  part two the metric tensor we're going  to consider a field we could consider  any field a magnetic field an electric  field a temperature field I'm going to  consider one of the most basic fields of  all a field with grass where the cows  graze here is my field and it's going to  be a very bumpy field there are hills  all over my field and here my standing  on one of the hills and the value of the  field is going to be for the height  above sea level so we usually give  the value Phi and everywhere you'll  agree in my field there will be a height  above sea level that I can measure and  that height will constantly change  because my field is a very bumpy field  now how do I know where I am  well I can impose a set of coordinates  here's my x co-ordinate here's my  y-coordinate and I am then at that  position that position on the x  coordinate and that position on the y  coordinate it's a bit like a map  reference so I uniquely define my  position and for every position I take I  can find a value of Phi which is  essentially the height above sea level  of my position in the field the question  I now want to ask is how does that  height change if I move a little bit and  you should immediately respond that it  depends on which direction I move the  reason for that is let's suppose that  part of the field consists of a reach  now a ridges something where the slope  goes down on one side and down on the  other side but along the top it's flat  so if I'm standing on the top of the  ridge and I move let's say this is the X  direction if I move in the X direction I  go down the ridge quite substantially  but if I go in the Y direction let's say  that's the Y direction I'm just walking  along the top of the ridge and that's  flat so direction of movement is  important in the X direction I would  drop considerably in the Y direction I  stay on level ground now how can I tell  by how much the height will vary as I  move along well let's consider a  gradient here is a gradient which I'm  going to call a one-in-ten gradient what  that means  is that for every 10 meters that I walk  along I will drop 1 meter so if I start  here and I walk 10 meters by the time I  get to the end I have not only walked 10  meters along  I have dropped 1 meter down and the way  you would describe that mathematically  is you would say that the change in  height as I walk along is equal to the  gradient which we express as defy by the  X the rate of change of height with  distance that's what 1 in 10 is the rate  of change in five the distance  multiplied by the distance you actually  walk DX let's just try that for a moment  the change in height will equal the  gradient well I told you what the  gradient is it's 1 in 10 and let's say I  walk 5 meters so that the distance DX is  5 meters that means that D Phi will  equal 5 over 10 which of course is a  half a meter so what we've just  calculated is that if you walk 5 meters  along a one-in-ten gradient your height  changes by half a meter but this is the  general form you change in height or  change in the value of field is equal to  the gradient multiplied by the distance  you travel now clearly in my field I'm  not going to have clear gradients like  this because it's a very bumpy and  irregular field but over a very very  small distance which is why I've put DX  and D fine  that will be true but as I said  direction matters so consequently one  would have to say that the change of  height if you are traveling in the X  Direction is equal to the gradient in  the X Direction multiplied the distance  multiplied by the distance you walk in  the X direction or you can also say that  the change in height in the Y Direction  is equal to the gradient in the Y  Direction multiplied by the distance you  walk in the Y direction which is fine  and these two gray  ian's will not of course be the same if  we were on the ridge this would be a  very steep gradient in the X direction  but there would be a level gradient in  the Y direction of course I may not want  to walk in just the X or the y direction  let's suppose that instead of walking in  X or Y direction I want to simply walk  in that direction just to be awkward  well of course that is that is simply a  combination of walking in the Y  direction and walking in the X direction  and in fact we can regard these as  vectors and in my video on the  manipulation of vectors I showed that  when you want to add vectors together  you do it by a tip-to-tail process so  that in fact you take these two vectors  dy and DX and you put them tip-to-tail  it doesn't matter which way you do it so  let's take DX it's like that then dy  goes the tip of the X vector matches the  tail of the Y vector so this is the X  this is dy and then the resultant is the  tail of the first and the tip of the  last so that becomes the resultant  vector which we call d s and we can use  pythagoras to work out what d s is of  course the s squared is equal to DX  squared plus dy squared that of course  is very simple if you want to add the  vectors together that gives you this is  the magnitude but for purposes of adding  the vectors together we simply say that  D s and we put a line above it to  indicate that it's a vector is equal to  DX + D Y or if we want to know what the  change in height is we can say that the  change in height as we go along the path  s is equal to the change in height as we  go along the path X plus the change in  height as we go along the path  why but these two terms here D X D Phi X  and D Phi Y we calculated up here that's  what these two terms say so I'm going to  substitute these values into this  formula here and that will give me that  D Phi s is equal to now for D Phi X I'm  going to replace that by the gradient  times the distance and here I'm going to  replace this by the gradient but this  time in the Y Direction times the  distance in the Y direction and to be  absolutely proper about all of this what  I should actually write here is I'm  going to give these gradient terms curly  DS and the reason I'm going to do that  is because that's what's called a  partial derivative it simply indicates  that although this is the derivative  with respect to X there are other  derivatives in this case a derivative in  respect to Y it's not the only  derivative so it's called a partial  derivative and it's indicated as a  partial derivative derivative by virtue  of having a curly D now I want to pause  for a while while I do a in the  miniature change and I promise you it  won't hurt up to now I have been using  the coordinates x and y I am now going  to change them wherever I have used X  before I'm going to call that x1 and  wherever I have used Y before I'm going  to call that X 2 why do I do that well  for three dimensions in space we  typically use XY and Z as our  coordinates suppose I needed another  coordinate what letter am I going to use  there isn't one after Zed I could of  course find another spare letter but  letters of the alphabet alphabet tend to  be used for different purposes in  physics and it you become very confusing  whereas if I relay  bullies x1 x2 and x3 if I need another  coordinate it's a piece of cake  it's x4 indeed I can even have an X  naught which I will actually use for a  time coordinate but find these further  dimensions of space I can have X 4 X 5 X  6 and so on there's no limit so firstly  changing the coordinates into this  system means I've got an unlimited  number of coordinates if I need them or  dimensions of space and secondly it  releases the Y system which I'm going to  use for a different purpose a bit later  on so now I'm going to rewrite this  equation here in my new coordinates  simply replacing X by X 1 and Y by X 2  they're exactly the same I've just  called them by different names so if I  do that I will get that D Phi which is  the overall change in height as far as  my field is concerned it's going to be  equal to the gradient which is defined  by the X and now that's the x1 times the  distance I move DX 1 plus the gradient  in the Y direction which is now the DX 2  Direction times the distance I move in  the X 2 direction and of course I could  add further terms X 3 X 4 X 5 as many as  I need I'm only going to work in two  dimensions to keep it simple and I think  you'll see that this equation here can  be simplified by saying that D Phi is  equal to the sum over N of the gradient  divided by the n sorry divided by the X  n multiplied by the X n when n is 1 you  get that term there when n is 2 you get  this term here and the sum term means  you just add them together so this is a  very handy way of  summarizing the change in the value of  field according to all of these values  and you'll notice that n is the  summation term you have to do this for  all values of n here I'm only having two  dimensions but however many dimensions  you have you need that number of terms  and I'm going to call that equation  number I hope you can see that let's  just write that again equation number  one and I'll put a box around it so that  when we refer to it later you'll be able  to spot it now here comes the general  problem with relativity being special  relativity or general relativity any  rules that you come up with must be  independent of the frame of reference  that you're using to make the  observation in my videos on special  relativity which I will refer to during  the course of this presentation we show  that different observers measure  different distances and different times  depending on their relative velocity  that was called length contraction and  time dilation so if you want to have  something that is going to be  universally true you have to make sure  that it is true in all reference frames  so when I took my field where I was  standing on the hills and I put myself  at position P I set a coordinate system  which I call the XY coordinate system  but subsequently renamed x1 x2 and I  said that was my map reference x1 and x2  define my position but somebody else  could come along and create another set  of coordinates which we will call y1 and  y2 and now P of course I haven't changed  my position I'm still standing on the  hill at position P but as far as the y  frame of reference is concerned the  coordinates are quite different y1 and  y2 are quite different from  x1 and x2 even though I'm at the same  place and you'll notice that if I want  to express y1 in terms of x-coordinates  I have to express it both in terms of an  X 1 coordinate and next to co-ordinate  in other words the y1 position for my  point P is actually made up of an X  and then X 2 so the question then that  we have to come up with is if we know if  I know all the gradients which remember  we describe this V Phi by DX in in the X  frame of reference how can we find all  the gradients in the y frame of  reference and more to the point how can  we relate the two and for this we use  what's called the chain rule we say that  / dy and I'm going to pick the y coordinate you could pick y2 but I'm  just going to pick Y 1 that is equal now  according to the chain rule that's equal  to defy by the X 1 times DX 1 by dy  plus D Phi by DX 2 times the X 2 by dy  so you'll notice we're only ever  sticking to the Y 1 coordinate but we  sum over the X 2 coordinates because  remember I said that in order to  identify the Y 1 coordinate you need to  know all of the other x-coordinates this  can be summarized as D Phi by D Y and  now I'm going to call this D Y n because  it could be any could be 1 or 2 in my  two dimensional system and that's going  to be the sum over m of D Phi by DX M  times DX  M by dy n now let's just look at this  and compare it to this what I've done is  I've put the general value of n in for Y  here I just had y1 but it could have  been Y to you have to pick which one you  want it's either one or it's two but M  is a summation term you sum over n when  N is 1 you get that term when M is 2 you  get that term this is going to be  equation number 2 and I'll put a box  around that as well but let me just  repeat and emphasize n is the value you  choose  it's either y1 or it's y2 you make the  choice but M is a summation term you  have to sum over all the values of X  just to get one of the values with  respect to Y now I want to introduce you  to the concept of tensors we mentioned  that when we looked at the Einstein  field equations there were several  tensors what is a tensor well let me  start off by talking about a scalar a  scalar is something that has magnitude  but no direction temperature would be a  good example of a scalar it just has a  value 32 degrees centigrade a scalar is  what's called a tensor of Rank 0 now  consider a vector a vector of course has  magnitude and direction so it has a  length and it has a direction which is  often described as the angle to one of  the axes in this case to the x-axis and  a vector is described as a tensor of  Rank 1 and how does a vector transform  well we can use equation 1 that we  derived earlier and which is showing on  the screen so you recognize it and we  just make a slight adjustment to  so that instead of D Phi and D X we  replace it by the vectors themselves so  we would simply say that the vector in  the Y frame of reference and with the Co  ordinate n which we choose is equal to  the sum over m where m is now the  summation term of the as it were  gradient which is dy n over the X M  where m is the summation term times the  vector in the x frame of reference M so  that is the way in which we and I shall  call that equation number 3 
 这就是向量转换的方式，我们使用方程式1，我们对方程式1进行了推导并对其进行了一些修改，即wall中的向量而不是Y坐标系中向量的长度坐标等于该梯度项的和的乘积。 
M，其中m是X坐标系中路线坐标的总和，您必须对这些项求和才能获得y坐标系中的enth坐标。我们将要关注的张量是第二等级的张量以及rank第二的tensor是向量的组合，其中两者之间存在固定的关系that's the  way vectors transform we're using  equation 1 that we derived and modifying  it slightly that the vector in the wall  rather the length coordinate of the  vector in the Y frame of reference is  equal to the sum of the of this gradient  term times the M where m is summed of ** course coordinate** in the X frame of  reference and you have to sum over these  terms in order to get the** enth  coordinate **in the y frame of reference  the tensors that we will be interested  in are tensors of rank two and what a  tense of rank two is is a combination of  vectors where there is a fixed  relationship between the two so let's  just think of some system which has a  combination of vectors let's take a very  simple one let's put a block on the  floor and we're going to apply a force  to it in order to move the block a  certain distance X in this direction and  the work done will be the force times  the distance but of course we can't just  take the force we have to take the  component  of the force that is moving in the  direction we want to go so if that angle  is alpha then the component of the force  acting in the direction of movement is F  cosine alpha so the work done will be  the component of the force that's in the  direction we want to move times the  distance we travel and you can think of  F and X as being vectors X has a  magnitude and the direction the  direction is in the X Direction F has a  component that has a magnitude and a  direction the component at least of  force in the X direction it has  magnitude and direction so we've got  essentially something which combines two  vectors now the question is suppose the  force is in that direction  then the angle alpha will be 90 degrees  and the cosine of alpha is zero and  therefore the work done will be zero  because of course the block won't move  if you're pushing down on the block  you're not going to get it to move in  the X direction and here's the thing but  it doesn't matter what frame of  reference you apply to this system  whatever frame of reference you apply  that block will not move the value of  the work done will be zero in all frames  of reference and that's the value of a  tensor a tensor is the relationship  between two vectors and if the  relationship if the tensor has a value  of zero in one frame of reference  it must have a value of zero in all  frames of reference if that block  doesn't move it doesn't move it doesn't  matter what frame of reference you apply  to observe it it doesn't move tensors  therefore our relationships between  fixed relationships between two vectors  in such a way that if that  lationship equals zero in one frame of  reference it equals zero in all frames  of reference and that is why tensors are  so important in einstein field equations  so let's consider a combination of  vectors doesn't matter what it is for  these purposes we're going to take  vector a and we're going to take the  length coordinate of that vector  remember there are dimensions in space I  am actually using only two dimensions  for this simplistic analysis so M is  either one or two you choose which one  you want it to be and we take another  vector B and we'll take the nth  co-ordinate that can be one or two you  choose and we say that the combination  of the two becomes a tensor of Rank 2  which we indicate by saying that it has  those two coordinates M or two indices m  and N equals the vector a with the  coordinate or the dimension M and chord  and vector B with the nth dimension so  obviously if there are if I'm talking  about two dimensional space where M can  be either 1 or 2 and n can be 1 or 2  then T MN there can be 4 versions of  that tensor where m and M each have  values 1 and 2 if you've got three  dimensions of space m and n can each  have values 1 2 3 and so t MN has nine  different versions if there are four  dimensions of space time one time three  dimensions t MN will have 16 different  values well now I'm going to use  equation three that we derived earlier  and which should be showing on the  screen to take the vectors a and B so  we're going to take a.m. in the y frame  of reference and B M in the y frame of  reference and we're going to try and see  what they are in the x frame of  reference using equation three  well you can see that we've just got to  replace V in equation three by a and  then B so let's do a first of all we  need a some term I can't use em anymore  because that's already been used here so  I'll just introduce a value R remember  this is a summation term it's called a  dummy variable it doesn't matter what  you put and that's going to be dy m by  DX ah times a in the X frame of  reference ah that does the vector a and  now we need to do the vector B in the X  frame of reference which again from  Equation three comes  I now need another summation term it's  called it s and that's going to be dy n  by the X s times B in the X frame of  reference s so you sum over the are  terms and you sum over the S terms but m  and n are chosen they're the values you  happen to choose for this particular  equation well let's look and see what  this reduces to firstly am BN well  that's just the tensor t MN in the y  frame of reference because that's what  we selected here and that is going to be  equal to the sum over R and s and that's  not quite the right way to do it but  essentially you've got to some terms  here which I'm just going to simplify  here x dy M by the X R and then you've  got a dy in DX s times a X R B X s  that's that term and that term but what  is this well if you look at this term up  here you'll see that it's just another  tensor in this case it's the tensor in  the X frame of reference but its indices  are R and s and that I'm going to call  equation four and I'll put a block  around that because we may need that in  the future and that is called it gets a  technical term it's called the  contravariant transformation it's the  transformation from the y frame of  reference to the x frame of reference  for tensors there is an equivalent form  of tensor transformation that is called  the covariant transformation where the  indices which instead of being upstairs  go downstairs  but then the dy by the X terms are  changed into DX by dy terms so let me  just write that out you get the T and  now it's in the Y frame of reference but  the M&N; go downstairs so I'll put the  M&N; down here and to make it clear I'll  put Y in brackets so TMM in the y frame  of reference are equal to again you've  got this summation term over R and s and  now these two terms just go upside down  DX R by dy M DX s by dy n just inverting  these terms here and then the tensor  terms again goes downstairs but it's in  the X frame of reference and that is  called the covariant transformation and  to call that equation number five so  this is called the contravariant this is  called the covariant contravariant had  the indices upstairs covariant have the  indices downstairs contravariant have dy  by the X terms covariant had DX by dy  terms and it is actually the covariant  form of transformation that is going to  be of interest to us now I want to do a  little bit of manipulation with  something as basic as pythagoras  pythagoras applies to a  right angled triangle and if this is dx using our frame of reference in the X  frame of reference and this is x2 this  is the s the hypotenuse then of course  you can easily say that according to  Pythagoras D s squared is equal to DX  squared plus DX 2 squared and if there  were further dimensions you would have  it plus DX 3 squared and so on  and your agree with you not that that is  simply the summation over m of DX m  times DX m in other words when m is  you get DX 1 squared that's that term  when M is 2 you get DX M you get DX M is  2 DX 2 all squared that's to that term  if M were 3 you would get the further  term DX 3 squared now I'm going to make  it a little bit more complicated but  you'll see why of course in a minute  that means that D s squared is equal to  the sum over m and n what am i doing of  DX m times DX n now you will say no that  cannot be right because there is no  combination of DX 1 DX 2 in Pythagoras  there is only DX 1 squared and DX 2  squared if you do this you're going to  get a DX 1 DX 2 term and we don't need  it  perfectly true so we add a further term  which is called Delta M N and that term  is called the Kronecker Delta and the  thing about the Kronecker Delta is it  has the value of 1 if M equals in and it  has the value of 0 if M does not equal n  so when M  n then you simply get the squared terms  that you want when M does not equal M  then this whole term becomes 0 because  Delta MN is 0 so if M does not equal n  all the cross terms come out and we'll  need that approach it's a very  complicated way of describing Pythagoras  Delta MN remembers the clinica Delta it  equals 1 if M equals n it equals 0 if M  does not equal N and therefore avoids  any of the dx1 dx2 terms that you don't  need in Pythagoras so I've rewritten  that formula that we just derived I've  simply put the chronica Delta at the  beginning rather than at the end it  doesn't matter where it goes and now I  want to remind you of equation one that  we derived and which should be on the  screen and I'm going to rewrite that in  a slightly different form I'm going to  say that DX m is equal to DX m by dy R  times dy bar and you'll notice that the  difference is that instead of Phi in  equation one I've used X M instead of  using M as the dummy summation term I've  used ah and I've changed round the x and  y-coordinates there's no reason why I  shouldn't do that so now I'm going to  take the value of DX m which is this  according to equation 1 and substitute  it in this equation here and then I'll  do the same for DX n so what I'm going  to get is that D s squared is equal to  Delta MN which is this term here plus  the summation term which we don't need  to worry too much about Einstein  actually dropped it he said it was  implicit he didn't even bother to put it  in but I'll just keep it there to show  that there is a summation going on and  then instead of DX M I'm going to put  this term here which is d X M by dy R  times dy R  and then we're going to multiply by dxn  which I'm going to put the equivalent  version here which is going to be DX and  by dy I now need another summation term  call it s times dy s so this term is  simply this term equals this this term  is this term modified equals this and  now I can rearrange that so that I can  say that D s squared is equal to Delta M  n we need a summation term let's just  bring the two gradients together DX M by  dy r DX n by dy s and that leaves us  these two terms here dy r dy s and  that's as it were a form of Pythagoras  but this term here is called the metric  tensor it's G M N and if you look you'll  see that there's an equivalence with  what we derived up here as pythagoras  pythagoras was simply the summation term  with a chronicle delta which made sure  you didn't get any cross terms here  we've got exactly the same thing we've  got d r squared is equal to combination  of these two elements here but instead  of having just a simple chronica delta  we've now got a more complicated metric  tensor so we can now write that d s  squared is equal to the metric tensor g  MN times dy r dy s and of course there's  a sum a sh gM contains a summation term  for flat space it's pretty obvious that  g MN is simply gonna reduce to the  Kronecker Delta term that should be d m  n Delta MN so it will be 1 when R equals  s and it will be 0 when R doesn't equal  so for flatspace the metric tensor will  either be 1 or 0 depending on where the  R equals s or not but here's the rub  suppose you aren't in flat space in flat  space it is perfectly true that if  that's DX 1 and DX 2 and that's d s it  is true in flat space that D s squared  equals DX 1 squared plus DX 2 squared  that's Pythagoras in flat space but that  is not true if you take a sphere and you  try to draw a triangle on the surface of  a sphere on the surface then this  formula which we derived which is just  lame Pythagoras that is not true on the  surface of a sphere and how do you make  the correction for that surface you make  the correction by introducing this  metric tensor so if you like you can  think of the metric tensor as the device  which makes corrections to pythagoras  when you have got the right angle  triangle on a curved space instead of a  flat space so you can begin to see the  value of the metric tensor if we're  going to talk about curved space-time so  here is the einstein field equations or  here are the einstein field equations  and the g mu nu terms are the metric  tensors we just derived why have they  got mu nu instead of em n the answer is  that you use mu nu when you also include  space-time what I just derived was  solely associated with space m and n if  you want to introduce time as well then  you say mu nu where mu can now be either  0 which means that's the time component  or 1 2 3 which are the three space  components  so that is the metric tensor and you may  now like to take another break okay we  now proceed to part three the  Christoffel symbols now you'll remember  that I said that the important thing  about tensors was that they represent a  fixed relationship between two vectors  and they are independent of the  coordinate system in particular if one  tensor is zero in one coordinate system  it will be zero in all coordinate  systems so let's suppose that we have a  tensor it's called it W and we'll take  the N and M coordinates in the X frame  of reference and we'll say that that is  equal to another tensor also with N and  M coordinates in the X frame of  reference if that is true in the X frame  of reference it must be true in all  frames of reference to take my example  of the field right at the beginning if  the height of the field is 2 meters it  matters not what frame of reference  you're talking about it will always be 2  meters but here's the problem the  problem is that the derivatives of  tensors do not necessarily transform  between frames of reference and we're  going to need derivatives of tensors so  we need to know what goes wrong so let's  take a tensor in the X frame of  reference which we'll call t m in in the  x frame of reference and let's say that  that equals the derivative of a vector V  with respect to N in the X frame of  reference now the question is does that  same tensor in the y frame of reference  equal the derivative of the vector M  with respect to Y in the Y frame of  reference is  that true so the answer is no sadly and  we'll find out why I'm going back to  equation five which should appear on the  screen but I'm just going to rewrite it  exactly as it was that the tensor T my a  TM n in the y frame of reference is  equal to the XR by dy m times DX s by dy  n times t RS in the x frame of reference  that was just equation five  I dropped you'll notice the summation  term just as Einstein did and the s and  our terms are dummy variables you need  to sum over them but let's drop the the  the summation term well let's just  rewrite that that is going to be I'm  just going to rewrite this these terms  here DX r by dy m times DX s times dy n  but instead of TR s in the X frame of  reference I'm going to write use this  term here but of course in shape I'm  going to change em and end to R and s so  this now becomes from the equation above  D V R X divided by or is it work with  respect to DX s I've simply written t RS  in this form here a DV by DX term now if  you look at that combination of tones  there you've got what is essentially the  inverse of the chain rule this is a DX s  term V is this is a DX s term you can in  a sense contract this so it simply  becomes DV R by D Y N and so you get the  T M and Y which is what we're trying to  calculate so T MN in the y frame of  reference is equal to this term here DX  R by dy M times this contracted which is  just DB R by D Y so this DV are in the x  frame of reference / devo dy n and the  question we want to ask is does that  equal  DVM by dy n in the y frame of reference  so does it equal equal question mark  does it equal because we don't know  whether it does DVM in the y frame of  reference by dy n well what is this term  DVM by D Y n let's just write that out  the V M by dy n I'm going to use  equation 5 which is actually a tensor  term but remember tensors you can reduce  two vectors just by dropping one of the  indices and if you just do it for a  single index and you can see that dy DV  M by dy n is actually equal to the  derivative of with respect to Y n of DX  r by dy m times V R in the X frame of  reference that is what DV m by dy n is  if you take it from Equation number five  but looking at it only with one index  but this is a differentiation of a  product and you should know that if you  differentiate a product let's  differentiate a times B then the  differential of a product will be a  times D B plus B times D  a so if this is a and this is B then the  differential of that differential of a B  will equal so we've now got that DVM y  by the Y n which is this term here is  equal to a DB which is DX R by D Y M  times DB which is D V R in the X frame  by dy n that's d B plus B which is V R X  which will stick out here times da which  is the combination of these two  differentials so we've got D by dy n  times DX R by dy m D that's that  combination there now observe that this  term here is equal to this term here TM  n y equals that term there and we were  asking does that term there equal this  term and this term equals yes we've got  exactly the same answer that we wanted  those two are exactly the same except  there's an additional term here so  actually they are not equal we've got  this additional thing here and that  combination of differentials just that  little combination there is called gamma  capital gamma it's actually given the  title the Christoffel symbol and we  represent the indices that appear here  by putting since there's an R upstairs  we'll put an R upstairs and since  there's an N and an end  downstairs we'll put an N and the name  downstairs so that symbol that  Christoffel symbol that capital gamma is  simply a shorthand way of writing this  double differential pair it's the extra  term that says that those two things are  not equal in other words let's just make  it clear what we asked was does TM n in  the y frame of reference equal DVM by D  Y N and the answer was no it doesn't  because there's that extra term and the  way we get round that extra term is we  say that t MN y does equal a new concept  which we will call the covariant  derivative that's what that symbol means  of the M so it's not the ordinary  derivative we shown it was not we're  gonna call it the covariant derivative  and what is the covariant derivative  well the covariant derivative is going  to be the ordinary derivative the VM by  dy n which is what we thought it was but  it wasn't plus the Christoffel symbol  plus the correction term multiplied by  the arc ex and so we've now got a  transformation where you've got  derivatives which has to include this  Christoffel symbol it's the extra term  and I'm gonna call that equation 7 so  let's put a box around it  and now we can ask ourselves the  question so what is this Christoffel  symbol and it's the compensation for the  fact that the ordinary derivative of a  tensor in one frame of reference does  not transform you need the covariant  derivative in order that you can get a  transformation of a derivative of a  vector which is a part of a tensor and  that's important because a lot of the  Einstein field equations required  derivatives of tensors well we just did  that using vectors we're going to need  to expand that for the purposes of  tensors so let's take the covariant  derivative I'm going to have to use P  because I'm going to use M and in in a  moment because I'm going to do the  covariant derivative of the tensor T M  in and that is going to be if you look  at the equation that we just derived  which is equation number 7 showing  essentially if I double that up for two  indices I'm gonna get the ordinary  derivative t MN by T y PE you will see  how that derives from equation seven but  now I'm going to need to Christoffel  symbols so I'm going to need one for the  M element and one for the N element so  this is going to be plus another  Christoffel symbol for the M element and  that's the transformation of a tensor  from one frame of reference to another  and we'll call that equation number  eight  now what about the covariant derivative  of the metric tensor that we derived  earlier let's just remind ourselves what  the metric tensor was we started off  with good old Pythagoras  where this was the X 1 this is the X 2  this is DS and we say that the S squared  equals DX 1 squared plus DX 2 all  squared and we said that you could  rewrite that as the sum of DX n times DX  and or if you like you could write that  as the sum of DX m DX n times the  Kronecker Delta M n where remember the  Kronecker Delta was 1 when M equals n  and it was 0 when M does not equal n and  we said that on flat space that is  essentially G MN for flat space it's not  true for curved space indeed that's the  reason you have the metric tensor G MN  it corrects Pythagoras for curved space  now what is the derivative we'll call it  the covariant derivative of G MN let's  say with respect to R in the X frame of  reference if we are talking about flat  space well in flat space the metric  tensor is either 1 or it is 0 it is a  constant so the covariant derivative of  a constant in flat space is 0 but what  did I tell you about derivatives of  tensors if you've got a value of 0 in  one frame of reference then you've got a  value of 0 in all frames of reference so  consequently the derivative of the  metric tensor  well the covariant derivative of the  metric tensor will  zero in all frames of reference which  means if we take this formula up here  equation number eight and replace just  write it down again but put T sorry put  G in in place of all the t's we will  have a transformation and or a value of  the covariant derivative of G in terms  of all these terms but the covariant of  G of course always equals zero so if we  replace T's by G's then this all becomes  zero so let's just do it I'm going to  take equation number eight and I'm  simply going to write it out again  exactly as it was but this time I'm  going to substitute G for all the t's so  I'm going to get DG m n by d YP plus the  Christoffel symbol p.m. and R of G are n  plus the Christoffel symbol P n R of G M  R and well I can now tell you is that  that the covariant derivative equals  zero so I can put that as zero and now  I've got an equation which has got the  metric tensor in it and a derivative of  the metric tensor and the Christoffel  symbol so I ought to be able to  rearrange that equation so that I can  express the Christoffel symbol in terms  of the metric tensor now for that you  need a mathematician so you go along to  your friendly mathematical professor and  I daresay Einstein did the same and he  will tell you that if you've got a  Christoffel symbol with just a B and C  then that is going to be equal to take a  deep breath 1/2 G a de where D is an  additional term it becomes an additional  summation term  to the derivative of G DC / DX B or by  DX B + remember the mathematicians come  up with this so we naturally take their  word for it - I hope this is going to  fit in  d G BC by DX D and I'll call that  equation 9 and what you've got courtesy  of the mathematicians is you've taken  this term which we ourselves managed to  derive you've jiggled in about so that  you've got because it equals zero  you've got the gamma terms the  Christoffel terms expressed in terms of  the metric tensor and first derivatives  of the metric tensor so what can you say  about this Christoffel symbol firstly  it's not itself a tensor it's in the  sense it's a correction term Christoffel  symbol will be equal to zero in flat  space but it won't be equal to zero in  curvilinear time space or space time and  you'll also notice that it can be  expressed wholly in terms of the metric  tensor and the first derivatives of big  metric tensor and you might ask yourself  why have we spent all this time trying  to find a thing called a Christoffel  symbol when it doesn't even feature in  the einstein field equations you will  not see a Christoffel symbol in that  equation in those equations the answer's  no you won't but that's because the  Christoffel symbol is buried in the  Ricci curvature tensor and that's what  we're going on to next but first I think  it's possibly time for another break ok  so now we come on to curvature if we're  going to talk about curved space time  we've ever  understand what curvature means let us  take a path in flat space flat space  fell flat space-time my paper is flat  what you do is you take a vector a  vector of course will have magnitude and  direction and what you do is you what's  called parallel transport it around the  path that means you keep the same length  of vector and you keep it oriented in  the same way so it travels parallel to  itself so all of those lines are  intended to be my drawing may not make  it quite so obvious but they are  intended to be the same length and all  of the vectors are parallel so they just  keep parallel for themselves until you  get back to where you started and of  course when you get back to where you  started your vector will be of the same  length and it will be in the same  direction because it's always moved  parallel to itself so it will come back  to where it started okay all very well  and good but now let's take a code here  is a cone which I have made for  illustration purposes as you can see  it's curved cone but I can do is I can  cut down the side of the cone and open  it up so if I make a cut along one line  I can then open the cone up and if he  comes flat and it has that kind of shape  so let me recreate the cone I just bring  those two lines together when it's a  cone that edge is joined up so in a  sense this edge here and this edge here  are the same line the same point on the  cone so let's just draw what the code  looks like when you open it up you cut  down this point here and you open it up  and you get a shape that looks like it's  a circle but with a slice taken out of  it that's the cone just a quick reminder  there is the cone and remember that the  line o ay and the line OB when they are  in a cone are the same line it's that  dotted line now I'm going to do a bit of  parallel transporting and to remember  where the vector was let me just take  that V out of the way and put it there  a B I'm going to have a vector which  continues the line OB so just a straight  continuation and now I'm going to  parallel transport that vector around  the cone remember it stays the same  length though mine may not it always  stays parallel and we keep going until  we get to a and we stop because a is  point B remember they are the same  points on the cone but what has happened  well the length of the vector is the  same but the direction of the vector has  changed  you can tell it's changed direction  because I started it as being an  extension of the line OB and OB is the  same as the line o a remember it's this  dotted line here so if the vector were  to be in the same direction it should  end up like that but it didn't he ended  up like this it's gone through an angle  so although the length has remained the  same the direction of the vector has  changed and that is a measure of  curvature if you parallel transport a  vector around a surface and you don't  get back and you get back to the same  position remember position a is position  B you get back to the same point but the  vector has changed direction then you've  gone round occur  so that's how we're going to define  curvature an angle change in the vector  when you parallel transport it  transported around a surface if it's a  flat surface as we showed no change in  direction if there's a curved surface it  changes direction now I'm just going to  take a slight diversion and a pause to  deal with two definitions the first is  what's called a commutator commutator  czar written like this square brackets a  and B and all that means is a B minus B  a a times B minus B times a now of  course if we are simply talking about  pure numbers then that will equal 0 3  times 2 minus 2 times 3 is 0 the point  about commutator is they don't always  equal 0 and I'm particularly going to  look at one which is the commutator of D  by DX and some function of X that's my  commutator and I'm going to show that  that actually equals D FX divided by DX  it doesn't equal 0 so let's just do a  quick proof remember that the commutator  is a B minus B a so it's going to be  that times that minus that times that so  let's just write that out that's going  to be d by DX of F X minus FX times D by  DX now you've got to apply a D by DX to  something so let's just call it V but  here we've got the differentiation of a  product and just as we did before we can  say that D a B is equal to BD a plus a  DB doesn't matter which way around you  do it  differential of a product BD a plus a DB  where this is a and this is B so  consequently this term here using this  formula here will equal B which is V  times da which is D FX by the X plus a  which is FX times DB DV v DX that is  that term and we must remember that term  there which is minus FX DV by DX and  you'll see that that term and that term  are equal so one minus the other is zero  and you're left with V times DF x times  DX well V is something we simply  inserted so we can now take that out and  now you've got that the commutator is  equal to DF X by DX which is what we  wanted to show in the first place so  let's now take two coordinates which do  not necessarily have to be right angles  this is the X mu of coordinate this is  the X new coordinate and I'm going to  have a distance which I'm going to call  DX mu and I'm gonna have a distance this  way which is DX new so a distance DX mu  in the X view coordinate system and a  distance DX new in the X new Co ordinate  what I'm going to do is construct a  parallelogram from that so essentially  it's going to be a parallelogram where  the length of these two are going to be  DX mu and that's the same there and the  length of these two sides D X new so far  so good and now I'm going to do a  parallel transport around this path  we're going to go from a  to B to C to D and back to a again but  I'm going to call the return point  a-prime because I'm not sure that we're  going to get back the victor will be  exactly the same when it gets to a prime  so the vector at a prime may not be the  same as the vector at a if we have gone  round a curved surface now let's just  take two paths consider two parts the  first is VC minus VD that's the  essentially what we're talking about  there is the difference between the  vector at Point C and the vector at  Point D and compare that with the vector  at point B and the vector at Point a now  if we are going around a flat surface  then the C minus PD will equal VB minus  VA and that whole term will equal zero  but what this is actually representing  is the differences in the D mu direction  because it's that's the or the DX mu  direction because that's the directions  that we're moving here similarly if you  take the C minus V B which is this path  here minus VD minus VA prime you get the  difference in the DX new direction  because that's that path there and that  path there they're parallel in flat  space there would be no difference but  in curved space there might be and  you're now looking at the difference in  the D new direction now let's have a  look at the difference of the  differences if we take this term here  and we subtract from it this term here  what do we get  well let's have a look at the VB term  we've got a minus VB and the minus minus  VB that becomes plus so we get a minus  plus zero we get no resultant VB term  then took an pc we've got a plus VC  minus VC the VC term goes BD we've got a  minus VD minus a minus VD so it's plus  minus plus the VD term goes as well what  about VA we've got a minus minus so that  becomes a plus so we've got VA and then  we've got for VA prime we've got a minus  minus minus so three minuses make a  minor so that becomes minus V a prime  and that's the difference of differences  that's going to be the change in the  vector as it is parallel transported  around that parallelogram as I say in  flat space no problem DV will be zero  because there won't be any change it  will just parallel transport round it  will come back to the same magnitude and  the same direction but it is in curved  space there will be a difference not in  length but in angle of the vector now  let's take this first term here VC minus  VD what actually is that well that is  the change as the vector goes from C to  D along a distance DX mu so VC minus VD  is simply the change in the vector along  the distance X mu multi multiplied by  the distance you travel which of course  is DX mu multiplied of course by the  vector itself so what we're saying is  that the change in the vector between C  and D is the gradient remember we did  this right at the beginning with our  field the gradient multiplied by the  distance times of course the  value of the vector but we've just  learned that we need to be very careful  about ordinary derivatives when you're  talking about curves you need to use the  covariant derivative so actually to be  more accurate we better call this the  covariant derivative so instead of using  this gradient we're going to use the  covariant derivative times DX mu that's  this term here times the value of the  vector that's a much healthier way of  doing it because we've just learned that  you have to be very careful about  ordinary derivatives when you're  transforming between different reference  systems now what is this term  BC - VD minus VB minus VA that is the  difference in the differences on on a  line which is separated by the distance  DX nu so essentially what you're doing  is you're looking at the difference of  vectors with a separation of DX nu which  means you have to apply a new gradient  to it so VC minus VD minus VB minus VA  which is this term here which is as I  said the difference in the vectors in  those two lines separated by different  distance DX nu well we said that VC  minus VD is the covariant derivative  times the distance times all that sorry  not knew that V times the value of the  vector but the difference is essentially  another differential and it's the  differential in the new direction so  we've now got to add covariant  derivative in the new direction times  the distance away so that is effectively  what that difference that difference  equals what about this one here  well this one will just be the opposite  in other words VC minus VB minus V  - VA prime is just gonna be well VC  minus VB will be the covariant  derivative but this time in the new  direction so now we need covariant  direction in the new direction times DX  nu times the value of the vector but  this subtraction means that you're  looking at the difference between this  line and this line separated by DX mu so  you're essentially applying another  differential but this time in that mu  direction so we've now got that that  term is essentially that term and this  term is essentially this term and what  we said was that if you subtract that or  if you subtract that term from that term  you get VA minus V prime a prime which  is the difference in the vector the  difference between the vector at the  starting point and the vector at the end  point so if you subtract this term from  this term you're going to get DV the  difference in the vectors so let's write  it out DV is going to be equal to that  term minus that term which is gamma nu  sorry a very derivative new covariant  derivative mu doesn't matter which order  we put these in DX nu DX mu V minus this  term covariant derivative mu covariant  derivative nu DX mu DX nu V and we can  pull out the DX nu DX mu and V because  author again doesn't matter here so that  becomes DX mu DX nu V into what's left  which is covariant new covariant mu  minus covariant mu covariant nu  and that you'll recognize of course is  simply the definition of commutator  which is of course simply Delta Nu comma  Delta mu not Delta's covariant  derivatives off but you'll remember that  from Equation seven the covariant  derivative is equal to the ordinary  derivative incidentally when I write D  nu like that what I really mean is D by  the X nu it's just a shorthand plus a  gamma term I won't write out the full  details of it but there was a gamma term  remember that was the correcting term  the Christoffel symbol term so wherever  we have this covariant form  we'll remember from Equation 7 that the  covariant form is the ordinary  derivative plus this correcting term  which involves the Christoffel symbol so  on that basis the commutator of which we  identified before is going to be equal  that times that minus that times that  that's what a commutator is but remember  that the covariant derivative is the  ordinary derivative times the assorting  plus the Christoffel term so we now get  that that is equivalent to this term is  d nu plus a Christoffel symbol  associated with nu times this term which  is the d mu plus the Christoffel symbol  associated with mu minus this term times  this term  I hope you can see that and let's just  multiply that all out so we've got a D  nu times D mu term then we've got a  gamma nu times D mu then we've got a  Dinu times gamma mu and finally we've  got a gamma nu gamma mu and that's that  all multiplied out from that we have to  subtract this term  well let's multiply that out we've got a  d mu times d nu those should be curly DS  by the way all of these should be curly  DS plus we've got a D mu gamma nu term  then we've got a gamma mu D nu term  and finally we've got a gamma mu gamma  nu term right let's do the subtractions  D nu D mu minus D mu D nu is equal to 0  because for ordinary derivatives the  order doesn't matter gamma nu D mu minus  D mu gamma nu will let a commutator in  fact that is equal to the minus the  commutator of D mu gamma nu gamma nu D  nu is equal to minus the commutator of D  nu gamma nu we've got another commutator  here D nu gamma mu minus gamma nu D nu  well that's just the commutator of D nu  gamma mu  then we've got gamma nu gamma mu minus  gamma mu gamma nu and that again is  going to be the commutator of whoops the  commutator of gamma nu gamma mu so just  remind you that was the commutator of  the two covariant vectors here or two  covariant terms here becomes this term  here but you may remember when I took  that diversion to talk about commutator  z' I said that if you have a function  like that that equals the derivative of  the gamma term with respect to X mu and  this becomes the derivative of the gamma  term with respect to X nu and this  entire term is called the Riemann tensor  and you'll notice that it is made up of  Christoffel symbols and derivatives of  Christoffel symbols it's called the  Riemann tensor I can tell you that for  our purposes it is also and can be  regarded as the Ricci tensor which we  need and that's why we needed to derive  the Christoffel symbols because as you  can see the Ricci tensor contains  Christoffel symbols and derivatives of  Christoffel symbols and the Ricci tensor  remember was the first term in the  Einstein field equations which I'm  showing you now just to remind you so  what we've just shown is that the change  in the vector remember the angle of  vector rather than the length is equal  to DX mu DX nu times V times the  commutator covariant nu  covariant Moo and that term we said was  the Riemann tensor but for our purposes  it's also the Ricci tensor so let's just  take stock of where we've got to we've  just shown that the Ricci tensor is made  up of Christoffel symbols and the  derivatives of Christoffel symbols but  what our Christoffel symbols will go  back to equation 9 and you see that  Christoffel symbols are made up of  metric tensors and the derivatives of  metric tensors and what are metric  tensors they can be thought of as the  device that you need to correct for  Pythagoras on a curved surface now what  I can also tell you is that from the  Ricci tensor arm you knew you can derive  what is called a curvature scalar it is  simply a scalar it is not a tensor not a  vector at just a scalar just as for  example if you take the dot product of  two vectors you get the scalar you can  take the Ricci tensor and from it you  can create a curvature scalar the point  about that is if the curvature scalar is  not zero then the surface is not flat  okay let's just review where we've got  to we've covered the metric tensor G mu  nu we've covered the Ricci tensor R mu  nu which includes a lot of Christoffel  symbols we've covered the curvature  scalar R and so we've covered most of  mine Stein's  field equations there are just two more  terms to go the stress energy momentum  tensor T mu nu and the cosmological  constant capital lambda but first time  for another break okay we're now ready  to do the stress energy momentum tensor  T mu nu what is the shortest distance  between two  answer a straight line what is the  shortest distance between two points say  on the surface of a sphere not two  points on a circle but two points on the  surface of a sphere the answer is the  shortest distance is what is called a  geodesic and on a sphere on the earth  for example the equator is a geodesic  any line of longitude is a geodesic the  shortest distance between two points  where you have to go round the curve you  can't go in a straight line is called a  geodesic and we can define what's called  a tangent vector DX mu by D tau as a  rate of change of the distance that we  travel with respect to time I'm using  tau because tau is what's called proper time you can find out what proper time is from my videos on special relativity the important point about proper time is it is the time which all observers no matter what frame of reference therein can agree on so if we use tau we know that there can be no arguments about what we mean so we're looking about the rate of change of distance with time and that's called a tangent vector and what we want to say is that the derivative of that tangent vector must equal zero in order to find the minimum distance so generally speaking if you want to find the minimum in a curve you take the derivative you take thee and you set that derivative equal to zero and that will give you the minimum it also gives you incidentally the maximum but in this case we're talking about the minimum so if you take the derivative of the tangent vector and set it to zero you will get as it were the path for the geodesic the shortest distance now when I say take the derivative remember we must always be cautious about derivatives in in general relativity we've already learned that can come a cropper if we take ordinary derivatives we need to go for the covariant derivative so let's take the covariant derivative of this tangent vector DX mu by D tau and from Equation 7 which should be on the screen you can see that that will essentially be the ordinary derivative plus a gamma term which I won't fill out but there is a gamma term remember that's the correcting term and what we can say is for the geodesic this term must equal zero so you've got this term Plus this term equals zero let's look at this term here this is essentially a double differential with respect to time it is if you like D to X mu D tau squared what does that look like isn't that acceleration the rate of change of the rate of change of distance with time D to X by DT squared is acceleration and that equals well if that Plus that equals naught this equals minus the gamma term well what does that look like let's remember that general relativity and Newton's law of gravitation need to be the same when you're just talking about ordinary masses ordinary speeds low speeds you're not talking a black about black holes because Newton's law of gravitation very nicely describes what appears to be gravity and so in the simple case general relativity and Newton's law must conform to the same thing Newton's law says that force is mass times acceleration or if you like that acceleration is a force term divided by mass and here we've got an acceleration is equal to minus a gamma term so what we can say is that that gamma term is the equivalent of force in Newton's laws and there'll be a mass term in it as well but mass is constant so let's forget about that this gamma term this Christoffel symbol has a kind of broad equivalence to force now to save time I just rewritten equation nine that we derived for the Christoffel symbol remember we said that it consists of metric tensor plus derivatives of the metric tensor now let's consider a situation where we're talking about low gravity low speed we're not in black holes we're not anything like that is just ordinary space slow movement general relativity must reduce to no to Newtonian gravity when that happens G becomes 1 and the derivative terms are very very small with one exception and that is the time term and time remember has mu and nu equal to 0 so the DG 0 0 0 by DX time component is the only term in the derivatives that has any significance all the rest when you're talking about slow speed small masses no black holes all these other terms are very very small the only one that has any significance is the time term and this term G becomes 1 and so that gamma term reduces to 1/2 that G becomes 1 so we can ignore that multiplied by all of this lot which is simply DG 0 0 0 by DX and that we said was equivalent to a force term so the force is kind of equivalent to this term here but in Newtonian mechanics force is minus the derivative of the potential for example if the potential energy near the earth is equal to mg X where X is the height above the earth then the force it will usually be given as minus mg X of course then the force will be minus D Phi by the X which equals minus mg the minus term simply indicates that the force is acting in one direction that X is measured in the other direction so all I'm showing here is that in Newtonian mechanics force is minus the derivative of the potential now we just show that the Christoffel symbol capital gamma is the equivalent of a force term and in ordinary space where we're not anywhere near black holes that it equalled the derivative of the time component of the metric tensor with respect to X and we've also just shown that force is minus the potential or the derivative of the potential with respect to X and so we can see that if gamma is a force term that these two terms are broadly equivalent and thus you get that G naught naught is equal to 2 Phi plus a constant from the integration that you need to do but you can forget all about the constant because as soon as we differentiate again that constant will go there is probably a minus sign in there somewhere but we don't need to worry too much about that either we're looking at the principle here what we're saying is that because the Christoffel symbol equals that and Christoffel symbol has a kind of force equivalence and in Newtonian mechanics force is equal to minus that if Rachele of the potential energy that you can therefore equate these two terms and if you equate those two terms essentially the metric tensor or the time value of the metric tensor is equal to two times the potential energy plus a constant now we said that force is minus D Phi sorry is minus D Phi by DX but of course we really need to do that in three dimensions and so that normally reduces to what is called the divergence of Phi where the divergence term is simply a D by DX plus a D by dy plus a D by DZ D term and that of course should be minus there but we also know from Newton's law of gravitation that the force is equal to minus G the gravitational constant times the mass of one object times the mass of the object other object divided by the square of the distance between them so let's consider an object of mass M and let's consider a distance R from mass M and we ask ourselves the question what is the force acting on a unit mass place a distance R from M well if the unit mass that means the unit mass is 1 the force will be minus G M over R squared because M is 1 what is therefore the force capability across the whole of that surface of that sphere well that's going to be the integral of F da where da is the area of the surface of the sphere and that's going to be the integral of the force which is minus GM over R squared times da well if you integrate out that of course is simply going to be equal to minus GM over R squared times times the entire area of the surface of that sphere of radius R which is 4 PI R squared the R Squared's cancel and so you find that that reduces to minus GM times 4 pi now there is a theorem called the divergence theorem which I won't derive but you can look it up I'll write it out first it says that the integral of F Da over an area is equal to the integral over the volume of Dell F DV and what that means in layman's terms is that the outward flux through the area of a sphere is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of the force that's just a divergence theorem that can be derived and you can look it up I also just want to remind you that density is mass divided by volume and that therefore you can say that the mass of an object will be the integral of the density with respect to volume so now I'm going to take F da which we calculated to be this term and set it equal to this term so you've now got that F dot Da is four pi G times M or more accurately minus four PI G times M but for M I'm going to use the integral of Rho DV density times volume that's F da or more accurately this the integral of F dot Da and that's going to be the integral of the volume of DF DV or del F DV the divergence of F well although it's not really proper to do it you can cancel out the D V's essentially what you're left with is that del F the divergence of F is equal to four PI G Rev actually minus four PI G unfortunately I had a camera failure for the next section so I'm just repeating the flow of the argument we've shown that the force is minus the derivative of the potential in Newtonian mechanics we've also just shown that the derivative of the force is equal to minus four PI G low consequently if the force is minus the derivative of Phi the derivative of force is the derivative of minus the derivative of Phi and that equals minus four PI G Rho in other words minus the derivative squared of Phi B potential equals four PI G Rho the minuses on both sides cancel earlier we showed that the time component of the metric tensor G zero zero equals twice the potential plus a constant which means that the potential is 1/2 the metric tensor I've dropped the constant that you'll see there's no problem without doing so because as soon as you do do a derivative of Phi derivative squared of Phi which is this term here replacing Phi by 1/2 G zero zero the constants will all go of course so now you've got that the derivative squared of Phi is four PI G Rho so the derivative squared of half the time component the metric tensor equals four PI G Rho and if you multiply both sides of the equation by two you get that the derivative squared of the metric tensor equals eight pi gee ro the problem with that is it's not a tensor equation and for general relativity we need tensor equations so what we're looking for is something that looks similar to it but we're on the left hand side of the equation you've got a tensor and on the right-hand side of the equation you've got tensor so we want something that has the form of G mu nu which is actually called Einsteins tensor is equal to 8 pi G but instead of having the mass density term Rho we want a tensor for energy something that contains all the mass energy stress pressure terms that you can have so we've essentially got to find something for this and something for that let's look at the T mu nu side of it first if you go back to my video on special relativity e equals mc-squared part 5 and go to the point in the video which is 2 minutes and 10 seconds in you'll find that we derive what is called a momentum four-vector the four vectors of course one dimension of time three dimensions of space and you'll find that we defined that momentum four-vector as being mass multiplied by X naught over tau X 1 over tau X 2 over tau and X 3 over tau and this is simply obviously that's the time component the X component the Y component and the Z component in the four dimensions of space-time divided by tau the proper time the time that everybody agrees and what we showed was that if you reduce this term you get essentially an MC squared which is energy e equals MC squared and these terms all effectively become the momentum in the different coordinates so it's MV in the x-direction MV in the y-direction and MV in the same direction so this for momentum reduces out to basic rest mass energy plus momenta in the three coordinates of space well that's fine but that is just of course essentially a vector we need a tensor we need not P that T mu nu and that means we need a four by four matrix and to save time I've drawn one and there it is you will see that T has all the values of mu and nu from naught to 3 and what do all these values mean well the top one T naught naught that is going to be the time component of the of the of the energy stress energy momentum tensor and that has this kind of equivalence it's the energy part of the tensor the three components along the top here I want to call the energy flow parts of the tensor the three components here I want to call the momentum density of the tensor and the nine components which are left are essentially the momentum flux stress pressure parts of the tensor now those we are embodying every part of energy that we can think of whether it be pure energy rest mass energy momentum stress all of it somehow finds a place in this stress energy momentum tensor it is if you like a measure of energy per unit volume now energy has the same units as work so we can think of this as work per unit volume work is Force Times distance distance is a length volume is a length cubed so that's equivalent force divided by a length squared which is force over area which is of course the units of pressure so that's how energy per unit volume can also embrace pressure or stress so that's given us we can't derive it but I'm trying to illustrate how we get here that's given us a stress energy momentum tensor with 16 different terms some of which it turns out are duplicates it comes in the form of a matrix it embodies all forms of energy and it's the stress energy momentum tensor that we use on the right-hand side of the Einstein field equation so now we've got on the right-hand side we've got the 8 pi G that we derived but we're going to replace the density term that we came up with with this new stress energy momentum tensor and we're going to have something on the left-hand side now what could it be this is as it were the mass term on this side we need something that is the space-time curvature term so Einstein thought that the obvious candidate for it would be the Ricci curvature tensor ah mutant ooh but there's a problem the problem is that we have a thing called energy conservation energy can be neither created nor destroyed so if you take the derivative of the energy tensor it should be zero there is no change in energy the problem is if you take the derivative of the Ricci tensor it does not equal zero so that equation can't be true because the derivative one side would be zero the derivative of the other side would not a bear in mind that we must always when we're talking about general relativity and field equations never do ordinary derivatives you will come unstuck we must always use the covariant derivative so if we've got that the covariant derivative of the energy side is zero we need something on the left-hand side whose derivative will equal zero now what Einstein actually found was that the covariant derivative of the Ricci tensor was not zero but it actually was one half times the covariant derivative of the metric tensor times the curvature scalar which we spoke about earlier have you got an equation like that you can bring everything to one side and essentially you get that the covariant derivative of the Ricci tensor minus half times the metric tensor times the curvature scalar equals zero and now we've got a covariant derivative of the term which equals zero we've got the covariant derivative of t MV equals zero and the covariant derivative of this term equals zero therefore that term and that term must be equivalent and so we've now got a left-hand side of the equation R mu nu minus 1/2 G mu nu times R equals the right-hand side of the equation when it's not just team you knew of course it's 8 pi G T mu nu and we're almost there it turns out four dimensional purposes you need to have a C to the fourth term here but that's essentially just a constant for dimensional purposes but Einstein realized he'd forgotten something you remember that earlier we showed that the covariant derivative of the metric tensor equals zero because it did it in one frame and therefore it must do it in all frames and therefore we could have included the we could have included the metric tensor in this equation here not just as a multiplier of R but in its own right and of course we could have included it with any constant in front of it so Einstein therefore decided that you needed to include this term in this equation again so now you need armed you knew minus 1/2 G mu nu R which is this just system here and now you need to include the fact that you could have had a metric tensor term in here so we'll add it and we will have a constant which we'll call capital lambda multiplied by the metric tensor and that equals 8 pi G T mu nu divided by C to the fourth this part you'll remember was the Einstein tensor G mu nu what is this capital lambda term where it's called the cosmological constant and curiously it is the constant which Einstein first thought of way back when he was trying to identify how you could describe space in mathematical terms now he was being told at the time that space was fixed and unchanging but nothing moved in space if he looked at it over a huge cosmological time and space frame obviously the earth goes around the Sun but generally speaking everything stays as it is that's what people thought an Einstein said well that can't be right because gravity would tend to make all the galaxies pull together and if I'm being told that they are not pulling together there must be something which is balancing gravity and pushing the galaxies apart so that gravitational attraction is being balanced by the thing that's pushing them apart and he found that you could reintroduce that into his Einstein field equations as the constant that you multiplied by the metric tensor this term is a very very small term and you will often find it will be left out of the Einstein field patience it only becomes relevant when you're talking about major cosmological scales and that's it we have derived in sorts the Einstein field equations just to remind you mu and nu are of course the time and space dimensions naught one two and three and therefore there are sixteen equations there but six of them are identical to another six so it reduces to just ten if you want more information I remind you that Leonard Susskind professor Leonard Susskind of Stanford University gave an excellent series in 2008 and I gave you the link to that at the beginning of this video that's it we're done the Einstein field equations for beginners 




你好，今天我要尝试推导出爱因斯坦场方程，这将是一个基本的介绍，虽然不够严格，但涵盖了要点，但是如果您想要更多的细节，它还是很复杂的，然后请您参考伦纳德教授
他在2008年10月至2008年12月在斯坦福大学上演的Susskind精彩演讲中，我在这些视频的注释中添加了这些演讲的YouTube版本的链接，我将按照他的方法进行操作，以使您熟悉它，但我将
用一个简化得多的版本做它，让我们永远记住，爱因斯坦花了十年的时间来开发这些方程式，他像往常一样接触了许多数学教授，我假设您了解微积分和基本几何，并且
您还已经看过或了解了YouTube上已发布的我的相对论视频中的信息，尤其是您了解了两个关键点，第一个是所谓的原理
等效性的意思是，如果您处在没有窗户的盒子里，那么您就无法分辨出处于外太空和以加速度G加速还是处于静止地球表面的同一盒子之间的区别
但是受制于加速度G的引力，没有实验让我们进入框内，没有实验可以做，这可以区分这两种情况，但实际上并不太正确，不同之处在于，如果
如果您在外太空中以加速度G行驶，那么如果您在地球上，那么包括您在内的所有物体的部分都将以加速度G加速，这是因为G的值根据地球上方的高度而变化，此时G的值
此时将比G的值稍大一点，因此在这种情况下G的值会有细微的差别，如果您可以进行测量，那么您就可以知道
这种差异被称为潮汐力，但爱因斯坦说那是等效原理，您无法分辨出该差异是在GE处加速还是在重力加速度下以加速度G表示。
原理是光在引力场中弯曲，这是爱因斯坦的推理，如果您将盒子里的那个人以加速度G加速通过空间，这就是盒子，那么这次我们要从中发出光芒
盒子的另一侧到盒子的另一侧，但当然要花费有限的时间，尽管它很小，而且如果在光线穿过盒子一半的时候该盒子以加速度G加速，将会进一步向前加速一点
所以现在就在这里，这意味着当光线到达右侧时，光线将到达该位置，盒子当然会加速
再往前走，现在当然是一条直线的光线会到达此处，所以如果您查看它，它会出现在框内，光线已经从此处射到了更低的点，甚至到达了更低的点。
总体来说，光是从这里到这里到这里，这至少是一条曲线，如果我正确地绘制它，那么爱因斯坦说，如果那是当您以加速度G加速通过空间时发生的情况，
原理上的等价原理说，你不能说出它与静止在加速度G下的地球之间的区别，那么在这种情况下应该发生同样的事情，此时光似乎会在引力场中弯曲，当然他现在可以
是错的，但实际上这在日食期间被证明是正确的。日食期间发生的事情是，月亮基本上挡住了太阳。
从地球上的位置注意到，他们可以看到一颗恒星恰好位于太阳的右边，但是他们知道天文学家知道那颗恒星实际上位于太阳的后面，所以不可能看到
它的解释是，实际上发生的是那颗恒星发出的光在太阳的引力场中弯曲，然后来到地球上给我们的印象是，恒星确实在这里，而实际上恒星确实在这里，但是
光在太阳的引力场中弯曲，这现在是爱因斯坦·牛顿的引力定律的问题，每个人都认为，引力定律作用了很长时间，一直说引力等于引力常数乘以一个物体质量乘以
用另一个物体的质量除以它们之间的距离R平方或除以距离平方，这很好，只是在这种情况下，光是
在引力场中找到，但是光的光子没有质量，因此这两个质量项至少是太阳具有S，但是光子不起作用，因此，如果将牛顿定律应用于光5，则这种形式的牛顿定律不起作用
光子没有数学运算，因此爱因斯坦想出了一种完全不同的引力方法，而不是引力。他说，实际上发生的是，所有形式的运动都由弯曲时空中的运动表示，我可以用这种方式说明一下
假设我们拿一个蹦床，这是蹦床的表面，代表时空，我们在该蹦床上放了一块小坚果大理石，大理石几乎不会产生任何影响，它可能会在蹦床上造成很小的压痕，但现在让我们来假设
如果我举起重物上蹦床，我会上蹦床，蹦床会相当弯曲，这相当于弯曲的时空或弯曲的时空， 
o碰巧在这块大理石上，大理石现在会向我倒下，这个比喻并不出色，但出于我们的目的，现在牛顿说向我的运动是由引力吸引力爱因斯坦引起的，相反，这不是什么意思。
发生的原因是大理石在弯曲的时空中沿着最短的路径移动，因此当地球绕着太阳旋转时，有太阳，这是地球绕着太阳旋转的合理的圆轨道。牛顿说，太阳之间存在万有引力
而提供向心力使地球保持在轨道上的地球，爱因斯坦说，不，不是所有的事情，这是因为太阳时空呈巨大的弯曲，而地球只是在弯曲的空间中沿着一条直线直线弯曲，
现在，您可能想知道两件事：第一，什么是时空；第二，为什么爱因斯坦认为它会很好地弯曲？
作为一组坐标t，我们通常认为空间具有三个维度，我们用三个维数表示正交轴，它们彼此成直角，因此通常x轴为y轴，z轴为
您喜欢我们在空间中上下左右三个维度，如果您添加时间维度，则会遇到具有四个时空的四个时空问题，这是很难绘制的，因为我们只能
设想三个维度，所以我要作弊，我将画一个时间维度和一个空间维度，即我可能引起的x轴，或者以这种方式绘制另一个维度，但我将其保留为一个维度
现在，如果您在时空中绘制恒定的速度，则时间的维数和空间的一维数将得到一条直线，因为一条直线是距离除以时间，它是恒定距离除以恒定时间，并且是恒定速度，但是如果
您在时空上加速时会得到曲线，原因当然是加速度意味着您走的时间越长，所以加速度会出现曲线，并且由于重力会引起加速度，因此会导致在这些空间中弯曲
时坐标和爱因斯坦的观点是，因此，如果它要创建加速度，则必须以某种方式弯曲时空，从而有效地在这些时空坐标中创建曲线，这就是引言的结尾，所以现在该到了
向您介绍我们正在试图推导的爱因斯坦场方程，在那里您可能会观察到只有一个方程，但实际上这是不正确的，因为您会注意到会有一些索引mu和nu出现
在等式中的几个地方，现在mu和nu表示时空的维度，而不是1和2 3零是时间1是x轴2是y轴并且z是对不起的3
是z轴，因此mu和nu可以分别在naught和3之间取四个值，并且mu和nu的组合表示此等式存在16个变化，其中mu和nu的数值在naught和3之间，因此您可能会认为
二维时空中有16个方程，但实际上其中6个是重复的，因此实际上减少了10个，因此您正在查看10个爱因斯坦场方程，现在所有这些象形文字意味着什么，您将很高兴知道
他们你已经知道了，你将知道1/2是什么，你知道8是什么，你知道PI是G是老式的老式引力常数，C是光速，所以我们只需要整理一些内容
首先，我们有一个特殊的术语R mu nu，它被称为Ricci曲率张量，将得出他们需要两个地方。我们得到了这个术语G mu nu G mu nu是度量张量，它将得出我们有R，但是
没有索引，称为曲率
标量，我们将显示那是什么，然后我们得到了资本λ，它原来是宇宙常数，我们将解释其原因，最后我们得到T mu nu，它是应力能动量张量和
我们将尝试解释该方程式的全部要点是，它平衡了两件事，左侧的一切都指时空的曲率，右侧的一切都与质量和能量有关
正如有些人有时会说些有用的话，爱因斯坦场方程基本上说的是，质量告诉时空如何弯曲，而弯曲时空告诉más如何移动，所以这是本视频其余部分的议程
引言接下来，我们将做度量张量，然后我们将继续使用Christoffel符号，它们是大写的gamma术语，您可能想知道为什么我需要这样做，因为它们似乎没有出现在爱因斯坦场方程中，但它们涉及很多
d在Ricci曲率张量中，因此我们需要使用Christoffel符号，然后看一下曲率本身，这将使我们能够导出Ricci曲率张量和曲率标量，然后看一下应力能动量张量，然后观察
宇宙常数，最后我们将它们放在一起，您可能想要在本视频中稍作休息，只是为了收集您的想法，然后再继续进行下一部分，现在您可能想稍作休息，现在第二部分是公制张量
要考虑一个领域，我们可以考虑任何一个领域，一个磁场，一个电场，一个温度场，我要考虑的是所有有草的领域中最基本的领域之一，这里放牧的牛是我的领域，
一个非常崎bump的田野，我的田野到处都是山丘，在这里，我站在其中一个山丘上，田野的价值将取决于海平面以上的高度，因此我们通常将值Phi赋予您所有的价值
e在我的视野中，会有一个可以测量的海拔高度，并且该高度会不断变化，因为我的视野是一个非常崎field不平的视野，现在我如何知道自己的位置，我可以在此处施加一组坐标
-ordinate这里是我的y坐标，然后我在x坐标上的那个位置和y坐标上的那个位置有点像地图参考，所以我唯一地定义了我的位置，对于我走过的每个位置，我都能找到一个
Phi的值，基本上是我在该领域中所处位置的海拔高度。我现在要问的问题是，如果我稍稍移动一点，该高度会如何变化，您应该立即做出反应，这取决于我向哪个方向移动
原因是让我们假设该区域的一部分由一个伸手可及的地方组成，现在某个山脊上的东西在一侧倾斜，另一侧向下倾斜，但是沿着顶部，它是平坦的，所以如果我站在顶部
里奇和我
ve如果我沿X方向移动，那么我就相当向下地走在山脊上，这就是X方向；但是如果我沿Y方向走，那么我就说这就是Y方向，我只是沿着山脊的顶部走，那是平坦的
因此，移动方向在X方向上很重要，我会在Y方向上大幅下降，我会停留在水平地面上，现在我如何确定随着高度的变化，高度会发生多少变化，让我们考虑一下这里的渐变
我要称其为十分之一的坡度，这意味着我每走10米，我就会掉落1米，所以如果我从这里开始，到终点时我走10米，
不仅沿着我走了10米，我掉下了1米，而且您在数学上的描述方式是，您说的是，我走时的高度变化等于我们用X表示的违抗率，即变化率
高度与距离之差等于十分之一
e以五分之一的变化率乘以您实际行走的距离DX来让我们尝试一下，高度变化将等于梯度，我告诉您梯度是十分之一，假设我走了5米
因此距离DX为5米，这意味着D Phi将等于10上的5，这当然是半米，所以我们刚刚计算出的是，如果您沿十分之一的坡度走5米，则您的身高
改变半米，但这是通常的形式，即您改变高度或改变场的值等于梯度乘以您现在在我的场中经过的距离，因此我不会像这样清晰的梯度，因为
这是一个非常崎and，不规则的区域，但是距离非常短，这就是为什么我将DX和D设置为正确的原因，但是正如我说的，方向很重要，因此，如果您是
在X方向上行驶的是e
等于X方向上的梯度乘以距离乘以您在X方向上行走的距离，或者也可以说Y方向的高度变化等于Y方向上的梯度乘以您行走的距离
在Y方向上很好，并且如果我们在山脊上，这两个灰度值当然不会相同，这在X方向上将是非常陡峭的渐变，但是在Y方向上当然会有水平梯度
可能不想只在X或y方向上走，让我们假设，我不想在X或Y方向上走，而是只是简单地朝那个方向走，以至于很尴尬，这当然就是在
Y方向和X方向走动，实际上我们可以将它们视为向量，在我关于向量操纵的视频中，我展示了当您想要将向量相加时，可以通过从头到尾的过程来完成，
事实
t取这两个向量dy和DX，然后将它们从头到尾放在一起，不管用哪种方式都无所谓，所以让我们取DX，就像dy然后dy沿着X向量的尖端匹配Y的尾部一样
向量，因此这是X，它是dy，然后所得的是第一个的尾部，最后一个的末端，因此成为所得的向量，我们称为ds，我们可以使用毕达哥拉斯找出ds当然是s
平方等于DX平方加dy平方，如果您想将向量相加就可以了，这很简单，这就是幅度，但是出于将向量相加的目的，我们简单地说D s并在上面加一条线
它表示它是向量，等于DX + DY，或者如果我们想知道高度的变化，我们可以说沿着路径s的高度变化等于我们的高度变化
沿路径X加上沿路径的高度变化，为什么这两个t
我们在这里计算出DXD Phi X和D Phi Y，这就是这两个术语的意思，所以我将在这里将这些值代入该公式中，这将使我D Phi s等于现在的D Phi X I
我要用渐变乘以距离替换它，在这里我要用渐变替代，但是这次是在Y方向乘以Y方向的距离，对于所有这些我应该是绝对正确的
实际上在这里写的是我要给这些梯度项赋予卷曲DS，而我这样做的原因是因为这就是所谓的偏导数，它只是表明尽管这是相对于X的导数，但还有其他导数
在这种情况下，相对于Y的导数不是唯一的导数，因此它被称为偏导数，并且由于具有卷曲D而被表示为偏导数，现在我想在微缩图中做一会儿
C 
hange，我保证你到现在为止都不会受伤。我一直在使用x和y坐标，现在我要在使用x的任何位置更改它们，然后再调用x1和之前使用Y的任何位置。
我要称其为X 2，为什么我在空间的三个维度上都做得很好，我们通常使用XY和Z作为我们的坐标，假设我需要另一个坐标，我要使用的字母是Zed之后没有一个。
当然会找到另一个备用字母，但是字母表字母通常会在物理上用于不同的用途，这会使您感到非常困惑，而如果我将霸凌x1 x2和x3传递给我，如果我需要另一个坐标，那简直就是小菜一碟，确实是x4
甚至可以有一个X零点，我实际上将其用于时间坐标，但是找到这些空间的进一步尺寸，我可以拥有X 4 X 5 X 6等，因此没有限制，因此首先将坐标更改为该系统意味着我已经
如果需要，坐标数不受限制
编辑它们或空间的大小，然后释放Y系统，稍后我将其用于其他目的，所以现在我将在这里在新坐标中重写此等式，只需将X替换为X 1并
Y X 2完全相同，我只是用不同的名称来称呼它们，所以如果我这样做，我将得到D Phi，这是就我的领域而言，高度的总体变化将等于
由X定义的渐变，现在是x1乘以我移动DX 1的距离加上Y方向上的渐变（现在是DX 2方向）乘以我在X 2方向上移动的距离，当然我可以添加
X 3 X 4 X 5尽可能多的术语我将仅在两个维度上进行简化，我想您会发现，可以说D Phi等于
当n为n时，梯度的N上的总和除以n后悔除以X n乘以X n
当n为2时，您将得到该项；当n为2时，您将在这里得到该项；和项意味着您将它们加在一起，因此这是一种非常方便的方法，可以根据所有这些值来汇总字段值的变化，您
'会注意到n是所有n值的总和项，在这里我只有二维，但是无论多少维，您都需要那个数量的项，我将其称为等式
希望您能看到让我们再写一次方程式一，并在其周围放一个方框，以便稍后我们引用它时，现在可以发现相对论是广义相对论或相对论。
广义相对论您提出的任何规则都必须独立于您在我的视频中对狭义相对论进行观察所使用的参考框架，在本演讲过程中我将参考这些参考框架，我们将证明不同的观察者可以进行测量
不同的距离和不同的时间取决于它们的相对速度，这称为长度收缩和时间膨胀，因此，如果您想要拥有普遍适用的功能，则必须确保在所有参考系中都适用，因此当我拍摄我的
我站在山上的田地上，将自己放在PI位置，设置了一个坐标系，我将其称为XY坐标系，但随后将其重命名为x1 x2，我说这是我的地图参考x1和x2定义了我的位置，但其他人可能会来
沿着并创建另一组坐标，我们将其称为y1和y2，现在P当然没有改变位置，我仍然站在山坡上的P位置，但是就y坐标系而言， 
y1和y2与x1和x2完全不同，即使我在同一个地方，您也会注意到，如果我想用x坐标表示y1，则必须同时表示
就X 1坐标而言，换句话说，在坐标旁边，换句话说，我的点P的y1位置实际上是由X然后是X 2组成的，因此我们必须提出的问题是，是否知道
我知道所有的梯度，记得我们在X轴参考系中用DX描述了V Phi，我们如何才能在y轴参考系中找到所有梯度，更重要的是我们如何将两者关联起来，为此我们使用
所谓的链式规则，我们说/ dy，我要选择y坐标，您可以选择y2，但我只是要选择根据等于X的defy的链式规则现在等于的Y 1。 
dy乘以DX 1乘以DX，D Phi乘以DX 2乘以dy乘X 2，所以您会注意到我们只坚持Y 1坐标，但我们对X 2坐标求和，因为记住我说的是为了
确定Y 1坐标，您需要知道所有其他x坐标，这可以用DY概括为D Phi，现在我是g
我们之所以称其为DY n，是因为在我的二维系统中它可能是1或2，这将是DX M乘以D Phi乘以D Phi的m的总和，现在让我们来看一下并进行比较
我所做的就是我将n的一般值放在Y中，这里我只有y1，但可能必须是Y，您必须选择一个或两个，但是M是
一个总和项，当N为1时，您对n求和。当M为2时，您得到该项。这将成为方程式2，我也会在其周围加上一个方框，但让我重复并强调n
是您选择的值是y1还是y2，但是M是一个求和项，您必须对X的所有值求和，以获取与Y有关的值之一，现在我想向您介绍
张量的概念，我们提到过，当我们研究爱因斯坦场方程时，有几个张量是什么张量，让我开始
f通过谈论一个标量，一个标量是一个具有大小但没有方向温度的东西，将是一个很好的标量示例，它只有32摄氏度的值。一个标量，即所谓的0级张量，现在考虑一个矢量
路线具有大小和方向，因此具有一定长度，并且其方向通常被描述为与其中一个轴相对于x轴的角度，矢量被描述为等级1的张量，并且
向量变换很好，我们可以使用先前导出的等式1，该等式1会显示在屏幕上，以便您识别它，我们只需稍作调整，以代替D Phi和DX，而是用向量本身替换它，因此我们只需
假设在Y坐标系中的向量以及我们选择的坐标n等于m上的总和，其中m现在是a的总和，因为它是梯度，在XM上为dy n，其中m是
总和时间
在参考M的x帧中的向量，因此我们将以这种方式称呼方程式3，这是向量转换的方式，我们使用的是方程式1，我们对方程式1进行了推导并对其进行了少许修改， 
Y轴参考系中向量的长度坐标等于该梯度项的和乘以M的总和，其中m是X轴参考系中当然坐标的总和，您必须对这些项求和才能
得到y坐标系中的enth坐标，我们将要关注的张量是第二张量，而第二张时态是向量的组合，两者之间存在固定的关系，所以让我们考虑一下
一些具有矢量组合的系统，让我们做一个非常简单的例子，让我们在地板上放一个积木，然后对它施加一个力，以使积木在此方向上移动一定距离X，完成的工作将
是力乘以距离，但我们当然不能只取力，而必须取沿我们要去的方向移动的力的分量，因此，如果该角度为α，则作用于力的分量
运动的方向是F余弦alpha，所以完成的功将是力的分量，即我们要移动的方向乘以我们行进的距离，您可以将F和X视为向量X的大小和方向
方向是在X方向上。F具有一个分量，该分量的大小和方向至少是X方向上的力的分量，它具有大小和方向，因此我们得到的东西实质上是两个矢量的组合，现在的问题是
力在那个方向上，则角度α将为90度，α的余弦为零，因此完成的功将为零，如果您向下推该块，则不会使其沿X方向移动，这就是问题，但无论对该系统应用哪个参照系，无论该块所应用的参照系如何
将不会移动完成的功的值将在所有参考系中均为零，即张量的值是张量是两个向量之间的关系，如果该关系如果张量在一个参考系中为零，则为零
如果该块不移动，它不移动，则在所有参考系中必须都具有零值。无论您应用哪个参考系来观察它，它都不移动张量都没有关系，因此我们之间固定关系之间的关系
两个向量的方式如下：如果该关系在一个参考帧中等于零，那么在所有参考帧中等于零，这就是为什么张量在爱因斯坦场方程中如此重要的原因，所以让我们考虑向量d的组合
不管这些目的是什么，我们将采用向量a，并且将采用该向量的长度坐标。请记住，空间中存在维，我实际上仅使用两个维来进行这种简化分析，所以M
是一个或两个，选择您想要的那个，我们取另一个向量B，然后取第n个坐标，这个坐标可以是您选择的一个或两个，我们说两者的组合成为张量
我们通过说具有2个坐标M或2个索引m和N来表示秩2的向量，其中n等于具有坐标或维数M的向量a以及具有n维的和弦和向量B，因此如果存在
谈论二维空间，其中M可以是1或2，n可以是1或2，然后T MN可以有该张量的4个版本，如果您具有三个维度的空间，则m和M的值分别为1和2 
m和n可以分别具有值1 2 3，因此t MN有9个差
租用版本，如果时空有四个维度，那么一次三个维度t MN将具有16个不同的值。现在，我将使用我们先前导出的等式3，应该将其显示在屏幕上以获取向量a和B
因此，我们将在y参照系中获取am，在y参照系中获取BM，我们将尝试使用等式3来查看x参照系中的值，您会看到我们
ve刚好要用a替换B中的等式3中的V，然后用B替换，所以首先我们需要一个不能再使用em的术语，因为这里已经使用了em，所以我只介绍一个值R记住这一点
是一个总和项，称为虚拟变量，与您输入的内容无关，DX将对dy乘以乘以X在参考框架ah中的a，即向量a，现在我们需要进行向量B
在X参照系中，再次从等式3中得出，我现在需要另一个
er求和项，它被称为s，它将乘以X参照系s中X的X乘以B，因此您对are项求和，并对S项求和，但是m和n被选择为
您恰好为该特定方程式选择的值让我们来看一下，它首先减少的是BN，即在y参照系中的张量t MN，因为这是我们在此处选择的，并且将等于
将R和s求和，这并不是正确的方法，但是本质上，您必须了解一些术语，这里我将通过XR简化x dy M，然后在DX中得到dy 
s乘以XRBX s就是那个术语和那个术语，但是如果你在这里看这个术语，这又有什么用呢，你会发现它只是另一个张量，在这种情况下，它是X参考系中的张量，但是它的索引是R
和s，我将调用方程式四，我将在其周围加上一个空格，因为我们可能需要
d将来称为技术变数，称为逆变。这是张量从y参照系到x参照系的转换，有张量转换的等效形式称为协变转换
这里的索引不是在楼上而是在楼下，而是X dy的dy变成dy DX的索引，所以让我写出来就是T，现在它在Y参照系中，但M＆N；
下楼，我就把M＆N
在这里，为了清楚起见，我将Y放在方括号中，以使TMM在y参照系中再次等于您在R和s上获得了这个求和项，现在这两个项在DX R上的作用是dy
由dy n表示的M DX只是在这里将这些项求逆，然后张量项再次下楼，但它在X参照系中，这称为协变变换，并称为等式5，因此将其称为对数
协变量对变量的索引在楼上协变量对楼下索引的变量dy按X项表示dy协变量按dy项表示DX，实际上我们现在将很感兴趣的是协变量形式的变换，现在我想做一点
毕达哥拉斯（pythagoras）的基本操作的一点点毕达哥拉斯（pythagoras）适用于直角三角形，如果在X轴参考系中使用我们的参照系将其设为dx，并且这是x2，则这是斜边
那么您当然可以轻松地说，根据毕达哥拉斯D平方等于DX平方加DX 2平方，如果还有更多尺寸，您可以将其加上DX 3平方，依此类推，您并不同意那不就是
DX m乘以DX m的m的总和，换句话说，当m为DX 1平方时，即该项；当M为2时得到DX M则得到DX M为2 DX2。如果M为3，则均等于该项
您将得到进一步的项DX 3平方，现在我要使其稍微复杂一点，但是您会明白为什么在几分钟之内意味着D s平方等于m和n的总和。
我用DX m乘DX n来计算，现在您会说不，那是不对的，因为在毕达哥拉斯中没有DX 1 DX 2的组合，如果只有DX 1平方和DX 2平方，您将得到一个
DX 1 DX 2术语，我们并不需要完全正确，因此我们添加了另一个术语Delta MN，该术语
称为Kronecker三角洲，关于Kronecker三角洲的事情是：如果M等于in，则值为1；如果M不等于n，则值为0；因此，当M n时，您只需得到所需的平方项
当M不等于M时，由于Delta MN为0，所以整个项变为0，因此，如果M不等于n，则所有交叉项都会出现，因此我们需要这种方法，这是描述毕达哥拉斯的一种非常复杂的方式Delta MN记得临床
如果M等于n，则Delta等于1；如果M不等于N，则Delta等于0，因此避免了毕达哥拉斯中不需要的任何dx1 dx2项，因此我重写了刚才推导的公式
年代记三角洲的开始而不是结束并不重要，现在我想提醒您我们推导出的方程式一，该方程式应该出现在屏幕上，我将稍稍重写一下
我要说DX m等于DX m等于d的不同形式
y R乘dy bar，您会注意到，不同之处在于，我使用XM代替了等式一中的Phi，而不是使用M作为伪求和项，我使用了ah，并且改变了x和y 
-coordinates没有理由我不应该这样做，所以现在我将根据公式1取DX m的值并将其替换为此处的公式，然后对DX n进行相同的处理
所以我要得到的是D s平方等于Delta MN，这是这里的这个术语加上求和项，我们不需要太担心爱因斯坦实际上就放弃了，他说这是隐含的，他没有
甚至不费吹灰之力就把它放进去了，但我会把它放在那儿以表明正在进行求和，然后我将把d XM乘以dy R乘以dy R来代替DX M。
然后我们将乘以dxn，然后将等价的版本放在DX上，然后我需要另一个求和
项称它为s dy s，因此该项简单地等于该项，此项被修改的项等于此，现在我可以重新排列，以便可以说D s平方等于Delta M n我们需要一个总和项
让我们将这两个梯度放在一起DX M by dy r DX n by dy s，这就是dy r dy s这两个术语，因为这是毕达哥拉斯的一种形式，但是这里这个术语称为度量张量GMN和
如果您看的话，您会发现我们在这里得到的等价物是等价的。pythagoras pythagoras只是带有年代记增量的总和项，可确保您在这里没有任何交叉项，我们得到的结果完全相同
在这里，平方的平方等于这两个元素的组合，但是我们不仅拥有一个简单的年代学增量，而且现在有了一个更为复杂的度量张量，因此我们可以写出平方的平方等于度量张量g MN次。 
dy dy s，当然还有
一个sh gM包含一个平面空间的总和，很显然g MN只是要简化为dmn Delta MN的Kronecker Delta项，所以当R等于s时将为1，而当R等于s时将为0。
不相等，因此对于平面空间，度量张量将为1或0，具体取决于R等于s的位置，但是这是假设您不在平面空间中的平面空间，如果它是DX 1和DX，这是完全正确的
2是ds，在平面空间中D s平方等于DX 1平方再加上DX 2平方即毕达哥拉斯在平面空间中是正确的，但是如果您选取一个球体并尝试在一个球体表面上绘制一个三角形，那是不正确的
在表面上，然后我们得出的这个公式只是球面表面上不正确的la子毕达哥拉斯，以及如何对该表面进行校正，因此可以通过引入此度量张量来进行校正，因此，如果您愿意，可以考虑一下
张量作为设备的
当您在弯曲空间而不是平坦空间上有直角三角形时，可以对毕达哥拉斯进行校正，因此，如果我们要谈论弯曲时空，则可以开始查看度量张量的值，因此这里是
爱因斯坦场方程或这里是爱因斯坦场方程，而g mu nu项是我们刚刚导出的度量张量，为什么它们得到mu nu而不是em n答案是，当您还包括时空时，您使用mu nu
如果您也想引入时间，则刚导出的空间仅与空间m和n相关联，那么您说mu nu，其中mu现在可以是0，这意味着时间分量，或者1 2 3是三个空间分量，所以就是
度量张量，现在您可能想再休息一下，现在我们继续第三部分Christoffel符号，您会记得我说过张量的重要之处在于它们代表两个向量之间的固定关系。 
d它们独立于坐标系，特别是如果一个张量在一个坐标系中为零，则在所有坐标系中都将为零，因此，让我们假设有一个张量称为W，我们将采用N和M坐标
X参照系，我们将说它等于另一个张量，在X参照系中也具有N和M坐标，如果在X参照系中为true，则在所有参照系中都必须为true
我的场的示例就在开始时，如果场的高度为2米，那么与您所讨论的参考系始终为2米无关紧要，但这就是问题所在，即张量的导数不
必然在参考系之间转换，我们将需要张量的导数，因此我们需要知道出了什么问题，因此让我们在X参考系中采用张量，我们将在x参考系中调用tm， 
SA 
y等于向量V相对于X参照系中的N的导数现在的问题是问题是y参照系中的相同张量等于矢量M相对于X的参照系中的Y的导数吗？
参考是正确的，所以答案不会很遗憾，我们将找出为什么我要回到屏幕上出现的方程式5，但我只是要重写它，就像张量T my a一样。
参考系y的TM n等于XR乘以dy m乘以DX s乘dy n乘以t RS等于x的参考系中的x R，这只是方程式5我丢掉了总和项，就像爱因斯坦所做的那样， 
s和我们的项是虚拟变量，您需要对其求和，但让我们去掉求和项吧，让我们重写一下，这将是我将要在这里重写这些项DX r dy m乘DX 
s乘以dy n，而不是X参照系中的TR s
这个术语在这里，但当然是形状，我要将em更改为R和s，所以现在这是从DVRX上面的等式除以DX得出的，或者对于DX来说是有效的。
现在在这里形成DV by DX术语，如果您查看音调的组合，您将获得本质上与链规则相反的东西，这是DX的术语V是这是DX的术语，您可以在某种意义上达成合同
这样它就简单地由DYN变为DV R，因此您得到的是TM和Y，这就是我们要计算的值，因此在y参考系中的T MN等于此项，此处DX R等于dy M乘以该收缩值，
只是DY的DB R，所以这个DV在参考帧的x帧/ dev dy n中，我们要问的问题是，在参考帧的y帧中Dyn是否等于dy n，所以它等于问号吗？
相等，因为我们不知道dy n是否在y参照系中进行了DVM操作DY n这个术语DVM是什么？
我用dy n写出VM，我实际上将使用等式5，这是张量项，但请记住，张量可以通过删除一个索引来减少两个向量，如果只对单个索引执行，
可以看到，dy DV M by dy n实际上等于DX r X y的Y n乘以dy m乘以X在参考帧中的VR，即如果从等式中得出，则DV m by dy n是
第五，但仅用一个索引来查看，但这是产品的微分，您应该知道，如果您对产品进行微分，我们将其乘以B，那么乘积将是DB乘以B乘以D a，所以
如果这是a并且这是B，那么B的微分将等于D，因此我们现在得到DVM y与Y n的乘积，这等于DB与DX R乘以DYM乘以DB
这是X帧中dy n的DVR，它是d B加B，这是VRX，它将伸出h
那时da是这两个微分的组合，所以我们得到D乘以dy n乘DX R乘dy m D，这就是那里的组合，现在观察到这里的这个术语等于这里的这个术语TM ny等于那里的那个术语，并且
我们问这个词是否等于这个词，这个词等于是，我们得到的答案完全相同，我们希望这两个词完全相同，只是这里有一个附加的术语，所以实际上它们不相等，所以我们得到了这个附加的
这里的东西和微分的组合就是gamma首字母gamma的小组合，实际上被赋予了Christoffel符号的名称，我们在这里表示出现的索引，因为在楼上有R，所以在楼上有R
在楼下是N，最后是楼顶，所以我们在楼下放一个N和名称，这样Christoffel符号即大写字母gamma就是写这种双差分对的简写方式，
多余的术语说这两件事不相等，换句话说，就是让我们清楚地知道，我们问的是y参照系中的TM n是否等于DYN的DVM，答案是否定的，不是，因为那是多余的
项和我们绕过该额外项的方式是说t MN y确实等于一个新概念，我们将其称为协变导数，即该符号表示M的含义，因此不是我们证明不是的普通导数，而是
我们将其称为协变导数以及什么是协变导数以及协变导数将成为dy n的VM的普通导数，这是我们认为的事实，但这不是加Christoffel符号加上校正项的乘积
在arc ex上，所以我们现在有了一个转换，在该转换中您必须有一个包含Christoffel符号的导数，这是多余的术语，我将其称为等式7，让我们在其周围放一个框，现在我们可以
问
我们自己就是问题，那么这个Christoffel符号是什么，它是对以下事实的补偿：张量的普通导数在一个参照系中不会变换，您需要协变导数才能获得向量的导数的变换
这是张量的一部分，这一点很重要，因为很多爱因斯坦场方程都需要张量的导数，所以我们只是做了一个事情，即使用矢量我们需要将其展开以达到张量的目的，所以让我们采用协变导数I
因为我要使用M，所以必须使用P，因为我要在其中进行张量TM的协变导数，所以这将是必须的，如果您看一下我们
刚刚得到的等式7基本上表明，如果我将其乘以两个指数，我将得到T y PE的普通导数t MN，您将看到它如何从等式7导出，但现在我要
o需要Christoffel符号，因此我将需要一个M元素和一个N元素，因此这将是为M元素加上另一个Christoffel符号，这是张量从一个参考系到
另一个，我们现在将其称为第8个等式，关于我们先前导出的度量张量的协变量导数呢？让我们提醒自己，度量张量是从好老毕达哥拉斯开始的，那里是X 1这是X 
2这是DS，我们说S平方等于DX 1平方加DX 2所有平方，我们说您可以将其重写为DX乘以DX的DX，或者如果您愿意，可以将其写为DX的总和
m DX n是Kronecker Delta M n的乘积，记住M等于n时Kronecker Delta为1，当M不等于n时为Kronecker Delta，我们说在平面空间上，对于平面空间，该空间本质上为G MN
空间确实就是
原因是您拥有度量张量G MN，它可以校正弯曲空间的毕达哥拉斯，现在的导数是什么？我们称其为X坐标系中相对于R的G MN的协变量导数。
在平面空间中，度量张量为1或为0，这是一个常数，因此在平面空间中常数的协变导数为0，但是我告诉您关于张量的导数，如果您的值等于0
参照系，那么您在所有参照系中的值为0，因此，度量张量的导数以及度量张量的协方差导数在所有参照系中将为零，这意味着如果我们在这里将这个公式代入公式
数字八并替换，只是再次写下来，但是对不起，将G替换为所有t，我们将获得所有这些项的G的变换和或G的协变量导数的值，但G的协变量当然是
总是等于零，所以如果我们用G代替T，那么这一切都变成零，所以就做吧，我将取等式8，我只是再次将其写成原来的样子，但是这次我是
用所有的t代替G，所以我要用d YP和Christoffel符号pm来获得DG mn 
G的R和R为n加上GMR的Christoffel符号P n R，我现在可以告诉你的是，协变导数等于零，所以我可以将其设为零，现在我得到了一个具有度量的方程
其中的张量以及度量张量和Christoffel符号的导数，因此我应该能够重新排列该等式，以便现在可以根据度量张量来表达Christoffel符号，因为您需要一个数学家，因此您继续
您友好的数学教授，我敢说爱因斯坦也做了同样的事情，他会告诉您，如果您的Christoffel符号只有B和C，那将意味着您需要深呼吸1/2 G a 
D是附加项，它成为G DC / DX B或DX B的导数的附加求和项+请记住，数学家提出了这一点，所以我们自然地接受他们的话-我希望这会适合d 
G BC by DX D，我将其称为等式9
并且您受到了数学家的欢迎是您采用了这个术语，我们自己设法使您陷入困境，因此您得到了它，因为它等于零，您已经获得了Christoffel术语表达的伽马项
就公制张量和公制张量的一阶导数而言，那么您可以对此Christoffel符号说什么呢？首先，它本身不是张量，在某种意义上，它是一个校正项Christoffel符号在平面空间中将等于零，但不会。
在曲线时空或时空中t等于零，您还会注意到它可以完全用度量张量和大度量张量的一阶导数表示，您可能会问自己为什么我们花了这么长时间
尝试找到一个甚至没有在爱因斯坦场方程中出现的Christoffel符号的东西时，您不会在这些方程中的那个方程中看到Christoffel符号，答案是不，您不会，但这是
因为Christoffel符号埋在Ricci曲率张量中，这就是我们接下来要讨论的内容，但是首先，我认为可能需要再休息一下，所以现在我们要谈谈弯曲时空的曲率问题。
我们曾经了解过曲率是什么意思，让我们在平坦的空间中走一条路径，平坦的空间落在平坦的时空中，我的纸是平坦的，您要做的是您取一个向量，向量当然将具有大小和方向，您所要做的就是您
所谓的沿路径并行传输意味着您保持矢量的长度相同，并以相同的方式定向，以便矢量平行于自身行进，因此所有这些线都是我的画图，可能并不太明显
但它们的长度应相同，并且所有向量都是平行的，因此它们只会保持平行，直到您回到起点为止，当然，当您回到起点时，向量将为o 
f长度相同，并且方向相同，因为它始终平行于自身移动，因此可以很好地返回到开始时的位置，但是现在让我们在这里获取代码是我为说明而制作的圆锥体
正如您所看到的，它是弯曲的圆锥体，但我能做的是我可以切掉圆锥体的侧面并打开它，因此，如果我沿一条线切开，我就可以打开圆锥体，如果他变平并且有
这样的形状，让我重新创建圆锥体，我只是将两条线连接在一起，当它是圆锥体时，边缘已连接在一起，因此从某种意义上说，这里的边缘和这里的边缘是圆锥体上同一点的同一条线，所以
绘制代码，将其打开时将其切开，然后在此处将其打开，您会得到一个看起来像是圆形的形状，但从其中切出的切片就是圆锥形，只是快速提醒一下
圆锥体，并记住当它们a
圆锥体中的那条线是那条虚线，现在我要进行一些平行运输，并记住向量的位置，让我将V移开并放在B处，
要有一个矢量来延续OB线，所以只是笔直的延续，现在我要平行传输该矢量到圆锥体上，记住它保持相同的长度，尽管我的可能并不总是保持平行，我们一直走下去直到得到
到a，我们停下来，因为a是点B，记住它们是圆锥上的相同点，但是发生的很好，向量的长度是相同的，但是向量的方向已更改，您可以说出它的方向已更改，因为我开始了
因为作为线OB和OB的扩展与线oa是相同的，所以请记住，这里是这条虚线，因此，如果矢量在同一方向上，则应该以这种方式结束，但他并没有以这种方式结束
它经过了一个角度
h长度保持不变，向量的方向发生了变化，这是曲率的度量，如果您将向量沿表面平行运输并且不回头并且回到同一位置，请记住位置a是位置
B您回到同一点，但矢量改变了方向，然后又变圆了，这就是当平面平行于表面运输时，我们将如何定义曲率，即矢量在矢量中的角度变化
表面，因为我们没有显示方向变化，如果有弯曲的表面，它会改变方向，现在我将略微改道，并稍作停顿以处理两个定义，第一个是所谓的换向器换向器czar，用这样的方括号表示
和B，这意味着现在是B减去B aa乘以B减去B乘以a现在当然，如果我们只是在谈论纯数字，则等于0 3乘2减去2乘3是0 
ommutator是它们并不总是等于0，我特别要看一个是DX的D换向器，而X的某些函数是我的换向器，我将证明它实际上等于D FX除以
DX不等于0，所以让我们做一个快速的证明，记住换向器是B减去B a，所以它将是那个减去那个倍的乘积，所以我们只写出这将是DX的d 
FX减去FX乘以DX的D，现在您必须将DX的FX乘以D，所以我们将其称为V，但是这里我们得到了产品的差异性，就像我们之前所说的D a B
等于BD a加上BD没关系，这与产品BD a加上DB的微分无关，这里是a且是B，因此，在这里使用此公式的此术语等于B等于V
乘以X乘以D FX的da乘以乘以DB DV v DX的FX乘以FX，即该项，我们必须记住该项
DX减去FX DV，您会看到那个项和那个项相等，所以一个减去另一个是零，剩下的就是V乘以DF x乘以DX井V是我们简单插入的东西，所以我们可以
现在将其取出来，现在您已经知道换向器等于DX的DF X，这是我们首先要显示的内容，因此，让我们现在获取两个不必一定是直角的坐标，这就是X 
mu坐标，这是X新坐标，我将有一个距离，我将其称为DX mu，我将以这种方式获得一个距离，这是DX新的，因此X视图中的距离DX mu
坐标系和X new坐标中新的距离DX我要做的是从中构造一个平行四边形，因此本质上它将是一个平行四边形，其中这两个的长度将为DX mu，并且相同
到目前为止，这两个方面的长度以及DX新的长度都很好，现在我要做一个paral
绕着这条路径进行lel传输，我们将从a到B再到C再到D再回到a，但是我将返回点称为a-prime，因为我不确定我们是否会得到
返回胜利者到素数时将完全相同，因此，如果我们绕过曲面，素数的向量可能与a的向量不相同。现在，我们采取两条路径考虑两个部分，第一个是
VC减去VD基本上就是我们要说的，如果我们要绕过一个点，那么C点的矢量和D点的矢量之间是有区别的，然后将其与B点的矢量和a点的矢量进行比较。
平面，那么C减去PD将等于VB减去VA，整个项将等于零，但这实际上表示的是D mu方向的差异，因为这就是或DX mu方向，因为这就是我们所要的方向
如果您使用C减VB，则类似地移动到此处
此处的路径减去VD减去VA质数，您会得到DX新方向的差异，因为那是那条路径，并且那条路径在平坦空间中是平行的，不会有任何区别，但在弯曲空间中可能会有所不同，您现在正在寻找
现在，让我们看一下D新方向上的差异，如果我们在这里采用这个术语，然后在这里减去它，我们会得到什么好结果，让我们看看我们获得的VB术语
负VB，负负VB变成加号，所以我们得到负加号零，我们没有结果VB项，然后拿了pc，我们得到了正VC负VC，VC项变为BD，我们得到了负VD负
负VD，所以它是正负VD项也是如此。
关于VA，我们有一个负的负号，所以它变成了一个加号，所以我们有了VA，然后我们得到了VA素数，我们有一个负的负号-负号，所以三个负号成为一个小负号，所以变成负号
质数，这就是差异的差异，这将是向量的变化，因为它围绕平行四边形并行传输，正如我在平面空间中所说的那样，DV不会为零，因为不会有任何变化，它将只是并行传输
它会回到相同的大小和方向，但是在弯曲的空间中，长度和向量的角度会有所不同。现在让我们在这里取第一个项VC减去VD，实际上是
当向量从C到D沿距离DX mu改变时，VC减去VD就是向量沿距离X mu的变化乘以您行进的距离，当然，DX mu当然也随向量本身相乘
所以我们在说什么
是C和D之间的向量变化是梯度，请记住，我们在一开始就这样做了，即梯度乘以距离乘以当然是向量值的距离，但是我们刚刚了解到需要
当您在谈论曲线时，非常小心于普通导数，因此您需要使用协方差导数，因此实际上，为了更准确，我们最好将其称为协方差导数，因此，我们将使用协方差导数乘以DX mu来代替此梯度。
这就是向量的值乘以向量的值，这是更健康的方式，因为我们刚刚了解到，当您在不同参考系统之间进行转换时，对于普通导数必须非常小心，这个术语BC- 
VD减去VB减去VA，这是一条线上的差值之差，该差值被距离DX nu隔开，因此，实际上，您正在做的是查看差异
向量的间隔为DX nu，这意味着您必须对其应用新的梯度，因此VC减去VD减去VB减去VA这是这里的术语，正如我所说的那样，这两行中的向量之间的差异由不同
距离DX nu很好，我们说VC减去VD是协变导数乘以距离乘以所有遗憾，我们不知道V乘以向量的值，但差值本质上是另一个微分，它是新方向的微分，所以我们
现在必须在新的方向上乘以相距导数乘以距离，这样实际上就是那个差等于这个东西的差了。这个东西恰好相反。换句话说，VC减去VB减去V-VA素数就是
将会很好VC减去VB将是协方差导数，但是这次是在新方向上，因此现在我们需要在新方向上将协方差方向乘以DX nu乘以向量bu的值
这个减法意味着您正在查看的是这条线与被DX亩分隔的那条线之间的差异，因此您实际上是在应用另一种差异，但这一次是在该亩方向上进行的，因此我们现在已经知道该术语实质上就是该术语
这个术语本质上就是这个术语，我们说的是，如果您减去该术语或从该术语中减去该术语，您将得到VA减去V素数，素数是矢量中的差，即起点之间的矢量之差
以及向量的终点，因此，如果您从该项中减去该项，您将获得DV中向量的差，因此我们可以写出DV将等于该项减去该项，即γ对不起
一个非常导数的新协变导数mu无关紧要，我们将它们放在DX nu DX mu V中减去该项协变导数mu协变量导数nu DX mu DX nu V，然后我们可以取出DX nu DX mu和V，因为
作者再次在这里无关紧要，因此将DX mu DX nu V变成剩余的变量，即协变量new协变量mu减去co变量mu协变量nu，您当然会意识到，换向器的定义当然就是Delta Nu
逗号Delta mu不是Delta的协变量导数，但是您会记得，从等式7来看，当我写D nu时，协变量导数等于普通导数，就像我真正的意思是X nu代表D只是一个简写加a
伽玛术语我不会写出它的全部细节，但是有一个伽玛术语请记住，这是Christoffel符号术语的正确术语，因此，无论我们有这种协变形式，我们都会从等式7中记住协变形式是普通形式。
导数加上包含Christoffel符号的校正项，因此在此基础上，我们之前确定的换向器将等于那个乘以那个乘以那个
这就是换向器，但是请记住，协变导数是普通导数乘以分类加Christoffel项，因此我们现在得出的等效值是d nu加上与nu乘以Christoffel符号乘以该项即d 
mu加上与mu负的Christoffel符号乘以本词乘以本词，我希望您能看到这一点，让我们将所有乘积相乘，这样我们得到D nu乘以D mu项，然后得到gamma nu乘以D mu
然后我们得到了一个Dinu乘以gamma mu，最后得到了一个gamma nuγgamma mu，这就是所有相乘所得的结果，我们必须减去这个项，让我们乘以，得到ad mu乘以d nu
应该是卷曲DS，所有这些都应该是卷曲DS再加上一个D mu gamma nu项，然后我们得到一个gamma mu D nu项，最后我们得到一个gamma mu Gamma nu项对，让我们
减去D nu D mu减去D mu D nu是否等于0，因为
对于普通导数，阶次无关紧要γnu D mu减去D mu gamma nu将使换向器实际上等于D muγnu的换向器减去γnu nu D nu等于D nu的换向器减去负。 
γnu我们在这里有另一个换向器D nuγmu减去gamma nu D nu恰好是D nuγγ换向器，然后我们得到了γnuγmu减去gamma muγnu，这又将是
换向器是伽玛nu gamma mu的换向器，所以提醒您，这里是两个协变矢量的换向器，或者这里两个协变项变成了这个术语，但是您可能还记得当我采取这种转移来谈论换向器z'时，我说过
如果您有一个像这样的函数，它等于相对于X mu的伽玛项的导数，并且它变成相对于X nu的伽玛项的导数，那么整个项称为黎曼张量，您会注意到
它组成
Christoffel符号和Christoffel符号的衍生形式被称为黎曼张量我可以告诉您，就我们的目的而言，它也是并且可以被视为我们需要的Ricci张量，这就是为什么我们需要派生Christoffel符号的原因，因为您可以看到
Ricci张量包含Christoffel符号和Christoffel符号的导数，Ricci张量还记得是爱因斯坦场方程中的第一项，我现在向您展示的只是为了提醒您，所以我们刚才显示的是向量的变化
记住向量的角度而不是长度等于DXμDX nu乘以V乘以换向器协变nu协变Moo，我们说的那个术语是黎曼张量，但出于我们的目的，它也是Ricci张量，所以让我们来看看
我们已经证明了Ricci张量由Christoffel符号和Christoffel符号的派生类组成，但Christoffel符号的作用是什么
回到方程式9，您会看到Christoffel符号由度量张量和度量张量的导数以及什么是度量张量组成，它们可以被认为是您现在需要在曲面上校正毕达哥拉斯的装置。
还告诉您，您知道从Ricci张量臂中可以得出称为曲率标量的东西，它只是一个标量，它不是张量，也不是标量上的矢量，例如，如果取两个点积
向量可以得到标量，可以采用Ricci张量，并可以从中创建曲率标量。关于这一点，如果曲率标量不为零，则曲面不是平坦的，好吧，让我们回顾一下到达的位置
我们已经涵盖了度量张量G mu nu，我们已经涵盖了Ricci张量R mu nu，其中包括许多Christoffel符号，我们已经涵盖了曲率标量R，所以我们涵盖了我的大部分斯坦因场方程，只有两个

表示应力能动量张量T mu nu和宇宙学常数资本λ的条件，但是第一次再次休息好了，我们现在准备做应力能动量张量T mu nu两个答案之间的最短距离是一条直线
什么是球面上的两点之间的最短距离，不是圆上的两个点，而是球面上的两个点？答案是最短距离，这就是所谓的测地线，而地球上的球
例如，赤道是一条测地线，任何经度线是一个测地线，您必须沿着曲线无法沿直线走的两点之间的最短距离称为测地线，我们可以定义切线向量DX 
mu t D tau是我们旅行的距离相对于我使用的tau的变化率，因为tau是所谓的适当时间，您可以从有关特殊relativit的视频中找出适当的时间
y关于适当时间的重要一点是，无论观察者在哪个参考框架上都能达成共识，所以如果我们使用tau，我们将知道关于我们的意思没有任何争议，因此我们正在研究比率
随时间变化的距离，称为切线向量，我们要说的是，该切线向量的导数必须等于零才能找到最小距离，因此通常来说，如果要在曲线中找到最小距离，
取您的导数，然后将导数设置为零，这将使您获得最小值，同时也使您得到最大值，但是在这种情况下，我们正在讨论最小值，因此，如果您求正切向量的导数，
将其设置为零，您将得到它，因为它是测地线最短的距离，现在当我说取导数时，请记住，在广义相对论中，我们必须始终谨慎对待导数，我们已经了解到，
如果我们采用普通导数，则需要求出协方差导数，因此让我们使用D tau来获取此切向量DX mu的协方差导数，从式7可以在屏幕上看到，您将看到，它本质上是普通导数
再加上一个我不会填写的伽马项，但有一个伽马项请记住，这是更正项，对于测地线，我们可以说该项必须等于零，所以您已经有了这个项，加上该项等于零，让我们来看一下
在这个学期，这基本上是时间的双重差，如果您喜欢D到X mu D tau平方，那看起来是不是在加速随着时间D变化的距离变化率
由DT乘以X的平方就是加速度，并且等于零，如果等于零就等于减去伽马项，那看起来像什么？让我们记住，广义相对论和牛顿万有引力定律在您只是
谈论普通质量普通速度低速并不是说黑洞，因为牛顿的万有引力定律很好地描述了似乎是万有引力的事物，因此在简单情况下，广义相对论和牛顿定律必须符合牛顿定律
表示力是质量乘以加速度，或者如果您喜欢加速度是一个力项除以质量，那么这里的加速度等于负伽马项，因此我们可以说伽马项等于力
在牛顿定律中也有一个质量项，但是质量是恒定的，所以让我们忘记这个Christoffel符号的伽马项具有广泛的等效性，现在可以节省时间。我只是重写了我们得出的等式9
对于Christoffel符号，请记住我们说它是由公制张量加上公制张量的导数组成的。现在让我们考虑一种情况，当我们谈论低重力低速时，我们并没有
ACK孔，我们不是什么，仅仅是普通空间慢速运动当G变为1且导数项非常小时，广义相对论必须减小到牛顿重力，除非一个例外，这就是时间项和时间
mu和nu等于0，所以DX时间分量的DG 0 0 0是导数中唯一对所有其余词都有意义的术语，当您谈论慢速小质量没有黑洞时，所有这些其他术语都非常
非常小，唯一有意义的是时间项，该项G变为1，因此伽马项减小为1/2，即G变为1，因此我们可以忽略该乘以所有这一切的总和，即DG 0 0 
DX等于0，我们说它等于一个力项，因此这里的力与这个力项相当，但是在牛顿力学中，力等于负势的导数，例如，如果地球附近的势能等于mg X 
X是高度
在地球之上，则通常将给出的力为负mg X，然后，力将为负D Phi乘以X，该X等于负mg负项仅表示力在一个方向上起作用，X的测量单位为
另一个方向，所以我在这里显示的是牛顿力学中的力减去势的导数，现在我们只显示Christoffel符号大写的γ等于力项，并且在普通空间中我们不在任何地方
在黑洞附近，它等于度量张量的时间分量相对于X的导数，并且我们还刚刚证明了力减去势或相对于X的势导数，因此我们可以看到
伽玛是一个力项，这两个术语大致相等，因此您可以得出G naught naught等于2 Phi加上您需要做的积分中的一个常数，但是您可以忘记所有关于常数的信息，因为只要我们
再次证明常数会去，那里可能有一个负号，但我们不必为此担心太多，要么我们在这里查看原理，要么说是因为Christoffel符号等于那个，并且
Christoffel符号具有一种力等价关系，并且在牛顿力学中力等于负，因此，如果势能的Rachele可以因此将这两个项等同，并且如果将这两个项等同起来则实质上是度量张量或度量的时间值
张量等于势能的两倍加上常数，现在我们说力是负D Phi，抱歉是DX负D Phi，但我们当然需要在三个维度上这样做，因此通常减小到所谓的
Phi散度，其中散度项只是DX的D加上dy的D加上DZ的D的D项，当然那里应该是负的，但从牛顿万有引力定律中我们也知道力等于min
我们用重力常数G乘以一个物体的质量乘以另一个物体的质量除以它们之间的距离的平方，所以我们考虑一个物体M，并考虑与质量M的距离R，我们问自己
问题是作用在单位质量上的力是什么，如果距单位M的距离为R，则表示单位质量为1的力将减去GM乘以R平方，因为M为1，因此整个力的承受力是多少
该球体表面的面积将是F da的积分，其中da是球体表面的面积，并且将是力的积分，如果减去积分，则力是GM减去R平方乘以da
当然，在R平方乘以半径为R的那个球体的整个表面的面积乘以4 PI R等于R平方的对消的平方，那么，它当然就等于负GM，因此您发现它减小到负GM 
pi 4倍现在在那里
这个定理叫做散度定理，我不会导出，但是您可以查找一下，我首先将其写出来，它说F Da在一个区域上的积分等于Dell F DV体积上的积分，以及
用外行的话来说就是通过球体区域的向外通量等于力的发散的体积积分，这只是可以导出的发散定理，您可以向上看，我也只是想提醒您
密度是质量除以体积，因此可以说物体的质量将是密度相对于体积的积分，所以现在我将取F da，我们将其计算为该项并将其设置
等于这个术语，所以您现在得到F点Da是M的四pi G倍或更准确地减去M的四PI G倍，但是对于M，我将使用Rho DV密度乘以体积的积分F da或
更准确地说，这是F点Da的积分，它将成为体积的积分
我是DF DV还是del F DV的人，所以F的发散不是很好，尽管您可以取消DV的本质，但实际上剩下的就是del F，F的发散等于四个PI G
不幸的是，Rev实际上减去了四个PI G，下一节我发生了相机故障，因此我只重复上述论点，我们已经证明了力减去了牛顿力学中的势导数。
力的导数等于负4 PI G低，因此，如果力为负Phi的导数，力的导数为负Phi的导数，等于负4 PI G Rho，换句话说，减去
Phi B电位的导数平方等于四个PI G Rho，两边的负号都更早地抵消了，我们表明，度量张量G零零的时间分量等于电位的两倍，再加上一个常数，这意味着电位是度量张量的1/2
我删除了const
蚂蚁，您会发现不这样做就没有问题，因为一旦您执行了Phi的导数平方的Phi导数（此术语是用1/2 G零零代替Phi的常数），那么常数当然就可以了
您已经知道Phi的导数平方是四个PI G Rho，因此，时间分量的一半的导数平方是公制张量等于四个PI G Rho，如果将方程式的两边都乘以2，就可以得出
公制张量等于八点pi问题是不是张量方程，而对于广义相对论，我们需要张量方程，所以我们要寻找的是与它相似的东西，但它位于图的左侧
等式中有张量，等式的右边有张量，所以我们想要某种形式为G mu nu的东西，实际上称为爱因斯坦张量等于8 pi G，而不是
有质量密度项Rho我们想要烯的张量
rgy一些包含您可能拥有的所有质量能应力压力项的东西，因此我们基本上必须为此找到一些东西，如果您返回我的专题视频，首先请看一下其T mu nu端。
相对论e等于mc平方的第5部分，然后转到视频中的点，即2分10秒，您会发现我们推导出了所谓的动量四矢量，这四个矢量当然是时间一维的三维
的空间，您会发现我们将动量四矢量定义为质量乘以x乘以tau上的X等于X，tau上的X 2等于tau上的X，t 3等于tau的X 3，这显然是时间X
时空四个维度中的Y分量和Z分量除以tau，即每个人都同意的正确时间，而我们证明的是，如果减少此项，则本质上将得到一个MC平方，即能量e等于MC平方，
这些条款都有效b
在不同的坐标系中吸收动量，因此它在x方向上的MV在y方向上的MV和在相同方向上的MV，因此这对于动量可以减少到基本静止质量能加上空间的三个坐标中的动量，很好，但是
当然，从本质上讲，这只是一个向量，我们需要一个张量，我们不需要P表示T mu nu，这意味着我们需要一个4乘4的矩阵，并且为了节省时间，我画了一个，在那里您会看到T具有所有
mu和nu的值从零到3，所有这些值都意味着什么，前T零，这将成为能量应力能动张量的时间分量，并且具有这种等效性
这是张量的能量部分，沿着顶部的三个分量在这里，我想称其为张量的能量流部分，在这里，我想称为张量的动量密度，剩下的九个分量基本上就是动量
通量应力压力p
张量的艺术现在体现在能量的每个部分上，我们可以思考它是否是纯能量，剩余质量能量动量应力，所有这些都以某种方式在此应力能量动量张量中找到了位置，如果您喜欢测量能量
每单位体积的能量现在与工作单位相同，因此我们可以将其视为单位体积的功为力乘以距离乘以距离，即长度是体积的立方，因此等效力除以长度的平方即面积上的力
当然，这是压力的单位，因此，每单位体积的能量也可以包含压力或压力，因此给定了我们不能导出的压力，但是我试图说明在给定应力能量动量张量的情况下如何到达此处
它有16个不同的术语，其中一些实际上是重复的，它以矩阵的形式出现，体现了所有形式的能量，这是我们在爱因斯坦场方程右侧使用的应力能动量张量，因此
现在我们在右侧获得了8 pi G，但是我们将用这个新的应力能动量张量代替我们提出的密度项，
现在在左侧有什么可能是什么，因为在这边是质量项，我们需要的是时空曲率项，因此爱因斯坦认为它的明显候选者将是Ricci曲率张量
啊，突变体ooh，但是有一个问题是，我们有一个所谓的能量守恒能量既不能产生也不能破坏，所以如果采用能量张量的导数应该为零，那么能量没有变化，问题是
取Ricci张量的导数不等于零，所以方程式不成立，因为一侧的导数为零，另一侧的导数不会记住我们在谈论时必须始终
广义相对论和场方程
否则做普通导数，您就不会被卡住，我们必须始终使用协变导数，因此，如果我们已经知道能量侧的协变导数为零，那么爱因斯坦实际上会发现左侧需要一些导数等于零的东西
是因为Ricci张量的协方差导数不为零，但实际上是度量张量的协方差导数乘以我们前面提到的曲率标量的一半，是否有一个等式可以将所有事物推到一边，
从本质上讲，您会得到Ricci张量的协变导数减去公制张量的一半乘以曲率标量等于零，现在我们得到了一个等于零的项的协变导数，我们得到了t MV的协变导数等于零
并且该项的协变导数等于零，因此该项和该项必须相等，因此我们现在得到了方程式R mu nu负1/2的左侧
G mu nu乘以R等于等式的右边，这不仅是您当然知道的团队是8 pi GT mu nu，而且我们几乎可以证明有四个维度的用途，您需要将C赋予第四个
术语，但从本质上来说，这只是一个常数，但爱因斯坦意识到他已经忘记了一些您还记得的东西，我们早些时候表明度量张量的协变导数等于零，因为它在一帧中完成，因此必须在所有框架中做到这一点
框架，因此我们可以将度量张量包括在此方程中，这不仅可以作为R的乘数，而且还可以单独包含，因此我们当然可以将其前面的任何常数包括在内，因此爱因斯坦因此决定
您需要再次将此方程式包含在此等式中，因此现在您需要武装，知道负1/2 G mu nu R，这是这里的唯一系统，现在您需要包括以下事实：
他
因此，我们将其添加，我们将得到一个常数，我们将其称为资本拉姆达乘以公制张量，即等于8 pi GT mu nu除以C到第四部分，您会记得这是爱因斯坦张量G 
mu nu这个大写的lambda术语是什么，它被称为宇宙常数。奇怪的是，这是爱因斯坦在试图确定如何用数学术语描述空间时首先想到的常数，现在有人告诉他
空间是固定不变的，但是如果他在一个巨大的宇宙时间和空间框架中观察它，则什么也不会在空间中移动，显然地球围绕着太阳旋转，但总的来说一切都保持不变，因为这就是人们所认为的爱因斯坦说得好而不能
是对的，因为引力会倾向于使所有星系拉在一起，如果有人告诉我它们不拉在一起，那么必须存在某种平衡引力并将星系推开的东西，以便引力子
国家吸引力正在被推动它们分裂的事物所平衡，他发现您可以将其重新引入到他的爱因斯坦场方程中，作为您乘以度量张量的常数，这个术语是一个很小的术语，您经常会发现它将
被爱因斯坦场的耐心所吸引，只有当您谈论主要的宇宙学尺度时，它才有意义。这就是我们以爱因斯坦场方程的形式得出的各种信息，只是提醒您，mu和nu当然是时间和空间维度的零头
第二个和第三个方程，因此那里有十六个方程，但是其中六个与另外六个方程相同，因此如果您想了解更多信息，可以将其简化为十个方程。我想提醒您，斯坦福大学的Leonard Susskind教授Leonard Susskind在2008年给出了一个出色的[https://stanfordvideo.stanford.edu/leonard-susskinds-general-relativity-lecture-1/](https://stanfordvideo.stanford.edu/leonard-susskinds-general-relativity-lecture-1/)
