评论说

给看不懂公式也听不懂英文的总结一下好了：  
1\. 首先从光速在任何惯性系中速度保持不变的假设出发，如果惯性系中存在引力场，那么物体实际上可以看做是处于一个加速惯性系内的，那么光在加速惯性系内必然会有弯曲的轨迹。  
2\. 大胆假设弯曲的不是光线，而是时空（经典的橡皮膜模型），那么应该有一个公式，将时空的弯曲程度（曲率，也就是视频中提到的Ricci tensor）与单位空间内产生引力场的质量（能量密度）关联起来。  
3\. 用了课程大半部分时间来解释metric tensor（任意两个坐标轴方向对空间内两点间距离的贡献）是什么，以及它们怎样组成Christoffel symbols（一个x坐标系内a轴单位向量在y坐标系内沿着b轴方向平移时，在y坐标系内c轴上的投影），最后通过围绕一个闭环路径的parallel transport推导出代表曲率的Ricci tensor与Christoffel symbols的关联。  
4\. 假设物体其实还是沿直线走的，因为坐标系弯曲所以路线被弯曲。（脑补一个人一直向东走直线，然而在月球上看他其实走的是曲线），那么前进方向的unit vector的covariant derivitive必然等于零，进而推导出在弯曲坐标中的加速度与Christoffel symbol的关系。


微分几何上几个重要的点也提一下：  
1\. 弯曲坐标系内，判断一个向量在沿坐标轴平移时是否保持不变，不能光看向量对坐标刻度的偏导是否为0，而要看covariant derivitive共变导数。  
2\. 用metric tensor来表示Christoffel symbols的公式，实际上可以通过对称交换index之后带入消元得到，纯代数操作，不用过多纠结。  
3\. Ricci张量: R\_mu\_niu 与Riemman Curvature标量:R都出现在了公式中， R = SUM\_ab( g\_ab * R_ab)得到，这里视频里好像没有提到。



5\. 通过低速环境下，狭义相对论近似于经典牛顿物理的情况假设，忽略四维坐标(ct, x, y, z)的代表空间的三维上的metric tensor，只考虑时间轴，因为c太大了，占绝对主导，那么可以很方便地简化Christoffel symbols，简化后发现上面第四条提到的关系正好能够帮助推导出重力势能与metric tensor中代表时间轴的元素是两倍关系。  
6\. 考虑一个点质量散发的引力场，利用了Divergence Theorem，推导出质量密度与metric tensor的二阶导数（covariant derivitive）成正比。  
7\. 根据之前点3中证明的metric tensor的二阶导数跟Ricci tensor曲率的关系，从数学上以及量纲分析上证实了曲率与质量/能量密度有关联的猜想。再后面就是一些约束条件（能量守恒）以及微积分工作，添加了2个修正项到公式里代表曲率的一侧。能量密度一侧也推算成为了动量flux，使其更为严谨。

总而言之，数学推导上已经比起教科书上简化直白了不少，微积分熟练一些的，同时拥有基本牛顿物理知识的，应该能按照视频的方法推演一遍。










好吧，感觉点赞的人好多????????，就再多说一些吧（从一个十分业余，十分不专业的角度）。看这个开头，感觉整个的顺序应该是：引言......度规张量.......克里斯托弗符号........里奇张量和曲率标量.......能量动量张量........最后的einstein场方程的推导，基本上都是数学（微分几何）里面的东西。事实上einstein的场理论就是研究物质的分布和运动怎样影响空间的弯曲，因此一边会是物质的分布（即能量动量张量），另一边则是含有空间弯曲的项，于是einstein理论的很重要的一个工作就是怎样研究弯曲空间（即数学中的黎曼几何）在弯曲空间的研究中，十分十分重要的就是列维奇维塔平移吧，也就是弯曲空间中的微积分，这个可以和我们普通的向量微分过程做一下对比，里面出现的添加量的系数就是克里斯托弗符号，研究在绕行一圈后的改变量就可以导出黎曼曲率张量，进而缩并为里奇张量和曲率标量，有这些，再结合度量距离时出现的度规张量，我们就可以了解所研究的空间的性质。如果懂一点多元微积分的东西（至少要知道梯度和链式法则），知道一点线性代数里面矩阵变换的知识（不知道可能会在推导时稍稍糊涂一些），然后了解一些狭义相对论的理论和整个相对论的背景知识的话，看起来应该不会有什么问题（至少我当时就是这么看下来的（⌒▽⌒），貌似上世纪初的物理专业的学生掌握的也差不多只有这些????）然后如果对相对论很感兴趣的可以去看一下赵峥老师的那本广义相对论基础，里面的前三章基本涵盖了这些东西。更深一点的可以去看刘辽老师的教材，另外梁灿彬老师的书从微分几何讲起，十分有数学味道。

Einstein Field Equations - for beginners! - YouTube

00:00

hello today I'm going to try to derive

00:02

the Einstein field equations this will

00:06

be a basic introduction it won't be

00:08

rigorous it will cover the essence but

00:11

it will still be quite complex if you

00:14

want more detail then I refer you to

00:16

Professor Leonard Susskind excellent

00:18

lectures that he gave from October to

00:20

December 2008 at Stanford I've put a

00:24

link to the YouTube version of these

00:26

lectures in an annotation on this video

00:29

I am going to follow his approach so

00:32

that it will be familiar to you but I

00:34

shall do it in a much more simplified

00:36

version and let's always remember that

00:39

it took Einstein ten years to develop

00:42

these equations and he had access to

00:45

many maths professors on the way as

00:49

usual I'm making the assumption that you

00:51

understand calculus and basic geometry

00:54

and that you've also seen or are aware

00:56

of the information in my general

00:58

relativity videos that are already up on

01:01

YouTube and in particular that you are

01:04

aware of two key points the first is

01:07

what is called the principle of

01:09

equivalence and what that says is that

01:12

if you are in a box with no windows then

01:16

you can't tell the difference between

01:18

being in outer space and accelerating

01:22

with an acceleration G or being in the

01:26

same box on the surface of the earth

01:29

stationary but subject to the

01:32

gravitational force which carries an

01:34

acceleration G there is no experiment

01:37

let's put you in the box

01:39

there is no experiment that you can do

01:41

that will distinguish between those two

01:44

situations now that is actually not

01:47

quite true the difference of course is

01:50

that if you are in outer space traveling

01:52

with an acceleration G then all parts of

01:56

this box including you are accelerating

01:59

at the acceleration G if you are on

02:03

earth then because the value of G varies

02:08

according to the height above the earth

02:10

the value of G at this

02:13

point will be ever so slightly greater

02:16

than the value of G at this point and so

02:20

there is a slight difference in the

02:22

value of G in this situation and if you

02:25

can measure that then you can tell the

02:27

difference that difference is called the

02:29

tidal force but apart from that Einstein

02:33

said that that was a principle of

02:35

equivalence you can't tell the

02:37

difference whether you are accelerating

02:39

at GE or subject to a gravitational

02:42

force which is represented by the

02:44

acceleration G the second principle is

02:48

that light bends in a gravitational

02:51

field this was Einstein's reasoning if

02:54

you take the person who is in the box

02:57

that is accelerating through space with

03:00

an acceleration G and here is the box

03:04

and this time we're going to shine a

03:08

light from this side of the box to the

03:11

other side of the box but of course that

03:14

will take a finite time albeit small and

03:17

if this box is accelerating with an

03:20

acceleration G by the time the light

03:23

gets halfway across the box will have

03:26

accelerated a little bit further forward

03:29

so it will now be here which means the

03:32

light will have reached that position

03:34

there by the time the light gets to the

03:37

right hand side the box will of course

03:39

have accelerated still further and now

03:45

the light which of course is just going

03:47

in a straight line will reach here so if

03:51

you look at it it appears within the box

03:54

that the light has gone from here to a

03:57

point lower down to a point even lower

03:59

down in other words the overall

04:01

impression is that the light has gone

04:04

from here to here to here and that's a

04:07

curve at least it should be if I've

04:09

drawn it properly so Einstein says if

04:13

that is what happens when you are

04:15

accelerating through space with

04:18

acceleration G since the principal the

04:21

equivalent says you

04:22

can't tell the difference between that

04:24

and being stationary on earth subject to

04:28

an acceleration G then the same thing

04:31

should happen in this scenario here that

04:34

light will appear to bend in a

04:36

gravitational field now of course he

04:39

could have been wrong but in fact this

04:42

was shown to be true during a solar

04:45

eclipse what happens during a solar

04:48

eclipse is that the moon essentially

04:50

blocks the Sun said that from the earth

04:53

the Sun as it were is blotted out and

04:57

what was noted from the position on

05:00

earth was that they could see a star

05:04

just slightly to the right of the Sun

05:08

but they knew astronomers knew that that

05:11

star actually was located behind the Sun

05:15

and it shouldn't have been possible to

05:17

see it and the explanation was that what

05:20

was actually happening was that light

05:22

from That star was being bent in the

05:25

gravitational field of the Sun and then

05:30

coming to us on earth giving the

05:32

impression that the star was here when

05:35

in fact the star was really here but the

05:38

light was being bent in the Sun's

05:40

gravitational field now here was the

05:43

problem for Einstein Newton's law of

05:46

gravitation which everybody had thought

05:48

had served as well for so long

05:50

says that the gravitational force is

05:53

equal to the gravitational constant

05:55

times the mass of one body multiplied by

05:59

the mass of another body divided by the

06:02

distance between them R squared or

06:05

divided by the distance squared and

06:08

that's fine

06:10

except that in this situation here light

06:13

is bending in a gravitational field but

06:16

photons of light have no mass so these

06:20

two mass terms were at least the Sun has

06:23

an S but the photon doesn't so this form

06:27

of Newton's law doesn't work if it is

06:30

going to apply to light five photons

06:33

have

06:34

no maths so Einstein came up with a

06:37

completely different approach to gravity

06:40

instead of there being gravity he said

06:42

actually what is happening is that all

06:45

forms of motion are represented by

06:48

movement in curved space-time and I can

06:53

illustrate that in this way let's

06:55

suppose that we take a trampoline this

06:58

is the surface of the trampoline and

07:01

that's representing space-time and we

07:05

put a small nut marble on that

07:07

trampoline the marble will have

07:09

virtually no effect it might make a very

07:12

tiny indentation on the trampoline but

07:15

now let's suppose I get on the

07:18

trampoline if I get on the trampoline

07:21

with my weight the trampoline is going

07:24

to bend quite substantially and that is

07:29

the equivalent of bent space-time or

07:32

curved space-time what's going to happen

07:34

to this marble

07:35

well the marble is now going to fall

07:39

towards me the analogy is not brilliant

07:43

but it'll do for our purposes now Newton

07:47

said that that movement towards me was

07:50

caused by gravitational attraction

07:53

Einstein on the other hand says no what

07:56

is happening is the marble is moving

07:59

along the shortest path in curved

08:02

space-time so that when the earth goes

08:06

around the Sun there's the Sun and

08:09

here's the earth in a reasonable

08:13

circular orbit going around the Sun

08:15

Newton says that there's a gravitational

08:19

force between the Sun and the earth

08:21

which provides the centripetal force

08:24

that keeps the earth in orbit Einstein

08:28

says no that's not it at all

08:30

what happens is the Sun being massive

08:32

curves space-time and the earth is

08:35

simply going round that curve in a

08:38

straight line in curved space-time now

08:42

you might be wondering two things

08:44

firstly what is space-time

08:46

secondly why did Einstein think that it

08:48

would be curved

08:49

well space-time is really just space and

08:53

time all thought of as one set of

08:56

coordinates we usually think of space as

08:59

having three dimensions which we

09:01

represent by three what are called

09:03

orthogonal axes they are at right angles

09:07

to one another so we normally have the x

09:09

axis the y axis and the z axis or if you

09:13

like we have three dimensions in space

09:15

up and down back and forth and side to

09:18

side if you add a time dimension to that

09:22

you get four-dimensional space-time

09:25

problem with four-dimensional spacetime

09:27

is it's very difficult to draw because

09:30

we can only conceive three dimensions so

09:34

I'm going to cheat and I'm going to draw

09:35

one dimension of time and one dimension

09:39

of space which is the x axis I could've

09:43

caused or another dimension this way but

09:46

I'll just leave it as one dimension of

09:48

time and one dimension of space now if

09:51

you draw a constant velocity in

09:54

space-time you get a straight line

09:57

because a straight line is distance

10:00

divided by time it's a constant distance

10:02

divided by a constant time and that is a

10:05

constant velocity but if you accelerate

10:09

in space-time you get a curve the reason

10:13

of course being that acceleration means

10:15

that the longer the time the further you

10:20

go so there is a curve in the

10:24

acceleration and because gravity causes

10:27

acceleration it causes a graph which is

10:31

curved in these space-time coordinates

10:34

and Einstein's view was that therefore

10:38

in some way space-time must be curved if

10:42

it is creating an acceleration which has

10:45

the effect of creating a curve in those

10:48

space-time coordinates well that's the

10:52

end of the introduction so now it's time

10:54

to introduce you to the einstein field

10:56

equations that

10:57

we're killing to try to derive and there

11:00

they are you may observe that there is

11:04

only one equation but in fact that's not

11:06

true because you will notice that there

11:09

are some indices mu and nu which arrive

11:12

arise in several places in the equations

11:16

now mu and nu represent the dimensions

11:19

of space-time not one two and three

11:23

naught is time one is the x axis two is

11:28

the y axis and z is the sorry three is

11:32

the z axis so mu and nu can each take

11:35

four values between naught and 3 and the

11:39

combination of mu and nu means that

11:41

there are 16 variations of this equation

11:46

with mu and nu having numbers between

11:48

naught and 3 you might therefore think

11:52

that there are 16 equations in

11:55

four-dimensional space-time but in fact

11:57

6 of them are duplicates so in fact it

12:00

reduces to 10 so you are looking at 10

12:03

Einstein field equations now what all

12:08

these hieroglyphics mean will you'll be

12:10

pleased to know that some of them you

12:11

already know you will know what 1/2 is

12:14

you know what 8 is you know what PI is G

12:18

is the good old fashioned gravitational

12:20

constant and C is the speed of light so

12:25

there are only a few things that we need

12:26

to sort out first we've got this

12:29

peculiar term R mu nu which is called

12:33

the Ricci curvature tensor will derive

12:36

that they need two places we've got this

12:39

term G mu nu G mu nu is the metric

12:43

tensor will derive that then we have R

12:47

but with no indices that's called the

12:51

curvature scalar and we'll show what

12:53

that is then we've got capital lambda

12:57

which turns out to be the cosmological

13:00

constant and we'll explain the reason

13:02

for that and finally we've got T mu nu

13:05

which is the stress energy momentum

13:09

tensor

13:10

and we'll try to explain what that is

13:13

now the whole point about this equation

13:15

is that it balances two things

13:18

everything on the left-hand side refers

13:22

to curvature of space-time everything on

13:26

the right-hand side is to do with mass

13:28

and energy and as some people have some

13:32

sometimes helpfully said that what

13:34

Einstein field equations basically say

13:37

is that mass tells space-time how to

13:41

curve and curved space-time tells más

13:45

how to move so here's our agenda for the

13:50

remainder of this video we've done the

13:52

introduction next we shall do metric

13:55

tensors then we'll move on to

13:57

Christoffel symbols which are capital

14:00

gamma terms you may wonder why I need to

14:03

do that because they don't appear to

14:05

feature in the Einstein field equation

14:08

but they are heavily involved in the

14:11

Ricci curvature tensor so we'll need the

14:14

Christoffel symbol then we'll look at

14:17

curvature itself which will enable us to

14:20

derive the Ricci curvature tensor and

14:23

the curvature scalar then we'll look at

14:25

the stress energy momentum tensor and

14:28

then the cosmological constant and

14:32

finally we'll put it all together you

14:35

may want to take a break through this

14:37

video just to collect your thoughts

14:39

indeed before we move on to the next

14:42

section you might fancy a break now okay

14:46

part two the metric tensor we're going

14:50

to consider a field we could consider

14:52

any field a magnetic field an electric

14:55

field a temperature field I'm going to

14:57

consider one of the most basic fields of

14:59

all a field with grass where the cows

15:02

graze here is my field and it's going to

15:07

be a very bumpy field there are hills

15:09

all over my field and here my standing

15:14

on one of the hills and the value of the

15:18

field is going to be for the height

15:21

above sea level so we usually give

15:25

the value Phi and everywhere you'll

15:28

agree in my field there will be a height

15:32

above sea level that I can measure and

15:34

that height will constantly change

15:36

because my field is a very bumpy field

15:40

now how do I know where I am

15:43

well I can impose a set of coordinates

15:47

here's my x co-ordinate here's my

15:50

y-coordinate and I am then at that

15:53

position that position on the x

15:56

coordinate and that position on the y

15:58

coordinate it's a bit like a map

16:00

reference so I uniquely define my

16:04

position and for every position I take I

16:07

can find a value of Phi which is

16:10

essentially the height above sea level

16:11

of my position in the field the question

16:16

I now want to ask is how does that

16:20

height change if I move a little bit and

16:24

you should immediately respond that it

16:27

depends on which direction I move the

16:31

reason for that is let's suppose that

16:33

part of the field consists of a reach

16:36

now a ridges something where the slope

16:41

goes down on one side and down on the

16:45

other side but along the top it's flat

16:50

so if I'm standing on the top of the

16:54

ridge and I move let's say this is the X

16:57

direction if I move in the X direction I

17:00

go down the ridge quite substantially

17:02

but if I go in the Y direction let's say

17:05

that's the Y direction I'm just walking

17:08

along the top of the ridge and that's

17:10

flat so direction of movement is

17:13

important in the X direction I would

17:16

drop considerably in the Y direction I

17:18

stay on level ground now how can I tell

17:23

by how much the height will vary as I

17:26

move along well let's consider a

17:29

gradient here is a gradient which I'm

17:33

going to call a one-in-ten gradient what

17:38

that means

17:39

is that for every 10 meters that I walk

17:41

along I will drop 1 meter so if I start

17:46

here and I walk 10 meters by the time I

17:49

get to the end I have not only walked 10

17:52

meters along

17:53

I have dropped 1 meter down and the way

17:57

you would describe that mathematically

17:58

is you would say that the change in

18:00

height as I walk along is equal to the

18:04

gradient which we express as defy by the

18:07

X the rate of change of height with

18:09

distance that's what 1 in 10 is the rate

18:12

of change in five the distance

18:13

multiplied by the distance you actually

18:16

walk DX let's just try that for a moment

18:20

the change in height will equal the

18:23

gradient well I told you what the

18:25

gradient is it's 1 in 10 and let's say I

18:28

walk 5 meters so that the distance DX is

18:32

5 meters that means that D Phi will

18:36

equal 5 over 10 which of course is a

18:38

half a meter so what we've just

18:40

calculated is that if you walk 5 meters

18:43

along a one-in-ten gradient your height

18:46

changes by half a meter but this is the

18:50

general form you change in height or

18:53

change in the value of field is equal to

18:55

the gradient multiplied by the distance

18:58

you travel now clearly in my field I'm

19:02

not going to have clear gradients like

19:04

this because it's a very bumpy and

19:06

irregular field but over a very very

19:09

small distance which is why I've put DX

19:12

and D fine

19:13

that will be true but as I said

19:17

direction matters so consequently one

19:21

would have to say that the change of

19:22

height if you are traveling in the X

19:25

Direction is equal to the gradient in

19:29

the X Direction multiplied the distance

19:33

multiplied by the distance you walk in

19:35

the X direction or you can also say that

19:39

the change in height in the Y Direction

19:42

is equal to the gradient in the Y

19:45

Direction multiplied by the distance you

19:48

walk in the Y direction which is fine

19:51

and these two gray

19:52

ian's will not of course be the same if

19:55

we were on the ridge this would be a

19:57

very steep gradient in the X direction

19:59

but there would be a level gradient in

20:01

the Y direction of course I may not want

20:05

to walk in just the X or the y direction

20:08

let's suppose that instead of walking in

20:12

X or Y direction I want to simply walk

20:16

in that direction just to be awkward

20:19

well of course that is that is simply a

20:24

combination of walking in the Y

20:27

direction and walking in the X direction

20:32

and in fact we can regard these as

20:36

vectors and in my video on the

20:40

manipulation of vectors I showed that

20:42

when you want to add vectors together

20:45

you do it by a tip-to-tail process so

20:48

that in fact you take these two vectors

20:50

dy and DX and you put them tip-to-tail

20:53

it doesn't matter which way you do it so

20:55

let's take DX it's like that then dy

20:58

goes the tip of the X vector matches the

21:02

tail of the Y vector so this is the X

21:04

this is dy and then the resultant is the

21:08

tail of the first and the tip of the

21:11

last so that becomes the resultant

21:14

vector which we call d s and we can use

21:18

pythagoras to work out what d s is of

21:20

course the s squared is equal to DX

21:23

squared plus dy squared that of course

21:27

is very simple if you want to add the

21:31

vectors together that gives you this is

21:33

the magnitude but for purposes of adding

21:36

the vectors together we simply say that

21:38

D s and we put a line above it to

21:41

indicate that it's a vector is equal to

21:43

DX + D Y or if we want to know what the

21:49

change in height is we can say that the

21:53

change in height as we go along the path

21:56

s is equal to the change in height as we

21:59

go along the path X plus the change in

22:03

height as we go along the path

22:05

why but these two terms here D X D Phi X

22:11

and D Phi Y we calculated up here that's

22:16

what these two terms say so I'm going to

22:18

substitute these values into this

22:23

formula here and that will give me that

22:26

D Phi s is equal to now for D Phi X I'm

22:30

going to replace that by the gradient

22:33

times the distance and here I'm going to

22:37

replace this by the gradient but this

22:39

time in the Y Direction times the

22:41

distance in the Y direction and to be

22:46

absolutely proper about all of this what

22:49

I should actually write here is I'm

22:52

going to give these gradient terms curly

22:55

DS and the reason I'm going to do that

23:00

is because that's what's called a

23:02

partial derivative it simply indicates

23:06

that although this is the derivative

23:08

with respect to X there are other

23:11

derivatives in this case a derivative in

23:13

respect to Y it's not the only

23:16

derivative so it's called a partial

23:17

derivative and it's indicated as a

23:20

partial derivative derivative by virtue

23:22

of having a curly D now I want to pause

23:26

for a while while I do a in the

23:28

miniature change and I promise you it

23:31

won't hurt up to now I have been using

23:34

the coordinates x and y I am now going

23:39

to change them wherever I have used X

23:42

before I'm going to call that x1 and

23:46

wherever I have used Y before I'm going

23:49

to call that X 2 why do I do that well

23:54

for three dimensions in space we

23:57

typically use XY and Z as our

24:01

coordinates suppose I needed another

24:04

coordinate what letter am I going to use

24:07

there isn't one after Zed I could of

24:09

course find another spare letter but

24:11

letters of the alphabet alphabet tend to

24:13

be used for different purposes in

24:15

physics and it you become very confusing

24:17

whereas if I relay

24:19

bullies x1 x2 and x3 if I need another

24:26

coordinate it's a piece of cake

24:28

it's x4 indeed I can even have an X

24:32

naught which I will actually use for a

24:36

time coordinate but find these further

24:39

dimensions of space I can have X 4 X 5 X

24:42

6 and so on there's no limit so firstly

24:46

changing the coordinates into this

24:49

system means I've got an unlimited

24:50

number of coordinates if I need them or

24:54

dimensions of space and secondly it

24:58

releases the Y system which I'm going to

25:01

use for a different purpose a bit later

25:03

on so now I'm going to rewrite this

25:06

equation here in my new coordinates

25:10

simply replacing X by X 1 and Y by X 2

25:15

they're exactly the same I've just

25:17

called them by different names so if I

25:20

do that I will get that D Phi which is

25:24

the overall change in height as far as

25:26

my field is concerned it's going to be

25:29

equal to the gradient which is defined

25:32

by the X and now that's the x1 times the

25:35

distance I move DX 1 plus the gradient

25:39

in the Y direction which is now the DX 2

25:42

Direction times the distance I move in

25:46

the X 2 direction and of course I could

25:49

add further terms X 3 X 4 X 5 as many as

25:53

I need I'm only going to work in two

25:54

dimensions to keep it simple and I think

25:58

you'll see that this equation here can

26:01

be simplified by saying that D Phi is

26:03

equal to the sum over N of the gradient

26:10

divided by the n sorry divided by the X

26:13

n multiplied by the X n when n is 1 you

26:21

get that term there when n is 2 you get

26:25

this term here and the sum term means

26:28

you just add them together so this is a

26:30

very handy way of

26:32

summarizing the change in the value of

26:35

field according to all of these values

26:38

and you'll notice that n is the

26:39

summation term you have to do this for

26:42

all values of n here I'm only having two

26:46

dimensions but however many dimensions

26:48

you have you need that number of terms

26:50

and I'm going to call that equation

26:53

number I hope you can see that let's

26:56

just write that again equation number

26:58

one and I'll put a box around it so that

27:02

when we refer to it later you'll be able

27:04

to spot it now here comes the general

27:08

problem with relativity being special

27:11

relativity or general relativity any

27:14

rules that you come up with must be

27:16

independent of the frame of reference

27:19

that you're using to make the

27:21

observation in my videos on special

27:23

relativity which I will refer to during

27:26

the course of this presentation we show

27:29

that different observers measure

27:31

different distances and different times

27:34

depending on their relative velocity

27:37

that was called length contraction and

27:40

time dilation so if you want to have

27:43

something that is going to be

27:44

universally true you have to make sure

27:47

that it is true in all reference frames

27:50

so when I took my field where I was

27:55

standing on the hills and I put myself

27:57

at position P I set a coordinate system

28:01

which I call the XY coordinate system

28:05

but subsequently renamed x1 x2 and I

28:10

said that was my map reference x1 and x2

28:16

define my position but somebody else

28:19

could come along and create another set

28:22

of coordinates which we will call y1 and

28:25

y2 and now P of course I haven't changed

28:30

my position I'm still standing on the

28:32

hill at position P but as far as the y

28:35

frame of reference is concerned the

28:38

coordinates are quite different y1 and

28:42

y2 are quite different from

28:45

x1 and x2 even though I'm at the same

28:48

place and you'll notice that if I want

28:52

to express y1 in terms of x-coordinates

28:59

I have to express it both in terms of an

29:02

X 1 coordinate and next to co-ordinate

29:06

in other words the y1 position for my

29:11

point P is actually made up of an X 1

29:15

and then X 2 so the question then that

29:19

we have to come up with is if we know if

29:22

I know all the gradients which remember

29:27

we describe this V Phi by DX in in the X

29:32

frame of reference how can we find all

29:37

the gradients in the y frame of

29:40

reference and more to the point how can

29:42

we relate the two and for this we use

29:46

what's called the chain rule we say that

29:49

/ dy and I'm going to pick the y1

29:53

coordinate you could pick y2 but I'm

29:55

just going to pick Y 1 that is equal now

29:58

according to the chain rule that's equal

30:00

to defy by the X 1 times DX 1 by dy 1

30:06

plus D Phi by DX 2 times the X 2 by dy 1

30:15

so you'll notice we're only ever

30:17

sticking to the Y 1 coordinate but we

30:21

sum over the X 2 coordinates because

30:24

remember I said that in order to

30:26

identify the Y 1 coordinate you need to

30:30

know all of the other x-coordinates this

30:34

can be summarized as D Phi by D Y and

30:39

now I'm going to call this D Y n because

30:41

it could be any could be 1 or 2 in my

30:44

two dimensional system and that's going

30:47

to be the sum over m of D Phi by DX M

30:56

times DX

30:58

M by dy n now let's just look at this

31:04

and compare it to this what I've done is

31:07

I've put the general value of n in for Y

31:10

here I just had y1 but it could have

31:13

been Y to you have to pick which one you

31:15

want it's either one or it's two but M

31:19

is a summation term you sum over n when

31:23

N is 1 you get that term when M is 2 you

31:29

get that term this is going to be

31:31

equation number 2 and I'll put a box

31:35

around that as well but let me just

31:41

repeat and emphasize n is the value you

31:45

choose

31:45

it's either y1 or it's y2 you make the

31:49

choice but M is a summation term you

31:52

have to sum over all the values of X

31:55

just to get one of the values with

31:58

respect to Y now I want to introduce you

32:01

to the concept of tensors we mentioned

32:04

that when we looked at the Einstein

32:07

field equations there were several

32:09

tensors what is a tensor well let me

32:12

start off by talking about a scalar a

32:15

scalar is something that has magnitude

32:17

but no direction temperature would be a

32:20

good example of a scalar it just has a

32:22

value 32 degrees centigrade a scalar is

32:28

what's called a tensor of Rank 0 now

32:34

consider a vector a vector of course has

32:37

magnitude and direction so it has a

32:41

length and it has a direction which is

32:44

often described as the angle to one of

32:46

the axes in this case to the x-axis and

32:50

a vector is described as a tensor of

32:55

Rank 1 and how does a vector transform

33:00

well we can use equation 1 that we

33:03

derived earlier and which is showing on

33:05

the screen so you recognize it and we

33:07

just make a slight adjustment to

33:09

so that instead of D Phi and D X we

33:13

replace it by the vectors themselves so

33:16

we would simply say that the vector in

33:18

the Y frame of reference and with the Co

33:22

ordinate n which we choose is equal to

33:27

the sum over m where m is now the

33:30

summation term of the as it were

33:35

gradient which is dy n over the X M

33:39

where m is the summation term times the

33:43

vector in the x frame of reference M so

33:48

that is the way in which we and I shall

33:51

call that equation number 3 that's the

33:59

way vectors transform we're using

34:01

equation 1 that we derived and modifying

34:04

it slightly that the vector in the wall

34:06

rather the length coordinate of the

34:09

vector in the Y frame of reference is

34:12

equal to the sum of the of this gradient

34:15

term times the M where m is summed of

34:19

course coordinate in the X frame of

34:22

reference and you have to sum over these

34:25

terms in order to get the enth

34:28

coordinate in the y frame of reference

34:32

the tensors that we will be interested

34:35

in are tensors of rank two and what a

34:39

tense of rank two is is a combination of

34:42

vectors where there is a fixed

34:45

relationship between the two so let's

34:50

just think of some system which has a

34:53

combination of vectors let's take a very

34:56

simple one let's put a block on the

34:59

floor and we're going to apply a force

35:02

to it in order to move the block a

35:06

certain distance X in this direction and

35:11

the work done will be the force times

35:16

the distance but of course we can't just

35:20

take the force we have to take the

35:22

component

35:23

of the force that is moving in the

35:27

direction we want to go so if that angle

35:30

is alpha then the component of the force

35:34

acting in the direction of movement is F

35:37

cosine alpha so the work done will be

35:43

the component of the force that's in the

35:45

direction we want to move times the

35:48

distance we travel and you can think of

35:50

F and X as being vectors X has a

35:55

magnitude and the direction the

35:57

direction is in the X Direction F has a

36:00

component that has a magnitude and a

36:03

direction the component at least of

36:05

force in the X direction it has

36:08

magnitude and direction so we've got

36:10

essentially something which combines two

36:13

vectors now the question is suppose the

36:18

force is in that direction

36:22

then the angle alpha will be 90 degrees

36:26

and the cosine of alpha is zero and

36:31

therefore the work done will be zero

36:35

because of course the block won't move

36:37

if you're pushing down on the block

36:39

you're not going to get it to move in

36:41

the X direction and here's the thing but

36:46

it doesn't matter what frame of

36:47

reference you apply to this system

36:51

whatever frame of reference you apply

36:53

that block will not move the value of

36:58

the work done will be zero in all frames

37:01

of reference and that's the value of a

37:04

tensor a tensor is the relationship

37:07

between two vectors and if the

37:09

relationship if the tensor has a value

37:12

of zero in one frame of reference

37:14

it must have a value of zero in all

37:19

frames of reference if that block

37:21

doesn't move it doesn't move it doesn't

37:24

matter what frame of reference you apply

37:26

to observe it it doesn't move tensors

37:29

therefore our relationships between

37:31

fixed relationships between two vectors

37:33

in such a way that if that

37:36

lationship equals zero in one frame of

37:37

reference it equals zero in all frames

37:40

of reference and that is why tensors are

37:42

so important in einstein field equations

37:46

so let's consider a combination of

37:49

vectors doesn't matter what it is for

37:51

these purposes we're going to take

37:52

vector a and we're going to take the

37:55

length coordinate of that vector

37:59

remember there are dimensions in space I

38:02

am actually using only two dimensions

38:04

for this simplistic analysis so M is

38:06

either one or two you choose which one

38:09

you want it to be and we take another

38:11

vector B and we'll take the nth

38:14

co-ordinate that can be one or two you

38:17

choose and we say that the combination

38:20

of the two becomes a tensor of Rank 2

38:25

which we indicate by saying that it has

38:28

those two coordinates M or two indices m

38:32

and N equals the vector a with the

38:37

coordinate or the dimension M and chord

38:41

and vector B with the nth dimension so

38:46

obviously if there are if I'm talking

38:49

about two dimensional space where M can

38:51

be either 1 or 2 and n can be 1 or 2

38:54

then T MN there can be 4 versions of

38:58

that tensor where m and M each have

39:01

values 1 and 2 if you've got three

39:04

dimensions of space m and n can each

39:08

have values 1 2 3 and so t MN has nine

39:12

different versions if there are four

39:15

dimensions of space time one time three

39:18

dimensions t MN will have 16 different

39:22

values well now I'm going to use

39:26

equation three that we derived earlier

39:28

and which should be showing on the

39:30

screen to take the vectors a and B so

39:35

we're going to take a.m. in the y frame

39:38

of reference and B M in the y frame of

39:41

reference and we're going to try and see

39:44

what they are in the x frame of

39:46

reference using equation three

39:49

well you can see that we've just got to

39:51

replace V in equation three by a and

39:54

then B so let's do a first of all we

39:59

need a some term I can't use em anymore

40:02

because that's already been used here so

40:03

I'll just introduce a value R remember

40:06

this is a summation term it's called a

40:08

dummy variable it doesn't matter what

40:09

you put and that's going to be dy m by

40:14

DX ah times a in the X frame of

40:20

reference ah that does the vector a and

40:24

now we need to do the vector B in the X

40:27

frame of reference which again from

40:29

Equation three comes

40:30

I now need another summation term it's

40:33

called it s and that's going to be dy n

40:37

by the X s times B in the X frame of

40:43

reference s so you sum over the are

40:47

terms and you sum over the S terms but m

40:51

and n are chosen they're the values you

40:54

happen to choose for this particular

40:56

equation well let's look and see what

40:59

this reduces to firstly am BN well

41:03

that's just the tensor t MN in the y

41:08

frame of reference because that's what

41:10

we selected here and that is going to be

41:12

equal to the sum over R and s and that's

41:17

not quite the right way to do it but

41:18

essentially you've got to some terms

41:20

here which I'm just going to simplify

41:22

here x dy M by the X R and then you've

41:29

got a dy in DX s times a X R B X s

41:40

that's that term and that term but what

41:44

is this well if you look at this term up

41:47

here you'll see that it's just another

41:49

tensor in this case it's the tensor in

41:52

the X frame of reference but its indices

41:57

are R and s and that I'm going to call

42:02

equation four and I'll put a block

42:06

around that because we may need that in

42:09

the future and that is called it gets a

42:14

technical term it's called the

42:16

contravariant transformation it's the

42:20

transformation from the y frame of

42:23

reference to the x frame of reference

42:25

for tensors there is an equivalent form

42:30

of tensor transformation that is called

42:32

the covariant transformation where the

42:36

indices which instead of being upstairs

42:39

go downstairs

42:41

but then the dy by the X terms are

42:46

changed into DX by dy terms so let me

42:50

just write that out you get the T and

42:53

now it's in the Y frame of reference but

42:56

the M&N; go downstairs so I'll put the

42:59

M&N; down here and to make it clear I'll

43:02

put Y in brackets so TMM in the y frame

43:05

of reference are equal to again you've

43:08

got this summation term over R and s and

43:12

now these two terms just go upside down

43:16

DX R by dy M DX s by dy n just inverting

43:24

these terms here and then the tensor

43:27

terms again goes downstairs but it's in

43:30

the X frame of reference and that is

43:34

called the covariant transformation and

43:39

to call that equation number five so

43:41

this is called the contravariant this is

43:45

called the covariant contravariant had

43:48

the indices upstairs covariant have the

43:52

indices downstairs contravariant have dy

43:56

by the X terms covariant had DX by dy

44:00

terms and it is actually the covariant

44:03

form of transformation that is going to

44:06

be of interest to us now I want to do a

44:09

little bit of manipulation with

44:11

something as basic as pythagoras

44:13

pythagoras applies to a

44:16

right angled triangle and if this is dx1

44:20

using our frame of reference in the X

44:24

frame of reference and this is x2 this

44:28

is the s the hypotenuse then of course

44:32

you can easily say that according to

44:35

Pythagoras D s squared is equal to DX 1

44:39

squared plus DX 2 squared and if there

44:44

were further dimensions you would have

44:46

it plus DX 3 squared and so on

44:49

and your agree with you not that that is

44:53

simply the summation over m of DX m

44:58

times DX m in other words when m is 1

45:03

you get DX 1 squared that's that term

45:07

when M is 2 you get DX M you get DX M is

45:12

2 DX 2 all squared that's to that term

45:16

if M were 3 you would get the further

45:18

term DX 3 squared now I'm going to make

45:24

it a little bit more complicated but

45:26

you'll see why of course in a minute

45:28

that means that D s squared is equal to

45:33

the sum over m and n what am i doing of

45:40

DX m times DX n now you will say no that

45:47

cannot be right because there is no

45:51

combination of DX 1 DX 2 in Pythagoras

45:54

there is only DX 1 squared and DX 2

45:57

squared if you do this you're going to

46:00

get a DX 1 DX 2 term and we don't need

46:03

it

46:04

perfectly true so we add a further term

46:07

which is called Delta M N and that term

46:12

is called the Kronecker Delta and the

46:15

thing about the Kronecker Delta is it

46:17

has the value of 1 if M equals in and it

46:22

has the value of 0 if M does not equal n

46:26

so when M

46:28

n then you simply get the squared terms

46:31

that you want when M does not equal M

46:35

then this whole term becomes 0 because

46:39

Delta MN is 0 so if M does not equal n

46:43

all the cross terms come out and we'll

46:47

need that approach it's a very

46:49

complicated way of describing Pythagoras

46:52

Delta MN remembers the clinica Delta it

46:55

equals 1 if M equals n it equals 0 if M

46:59

does not equal N and therefore avoids

47:02

any of the dx1 dx2 terms that you don't

47:06

need in Pythagoras so I've rewritten

47:09

that formula that we just derived I've

47:11

simply put the chronica Delta at the

47:13

beginning rather than at the end it

47:14

doesn't matter where it goes and now I

47:17

want to remind you of equation one that

47:20

we derived and which should be on the

47:22

screen and I'm going to rewrite that in

47:24

a slightly different form I'm going to

47:26

say that DX m is equal to DX m by dy R

47:33

times dy bar and you'll notice that the

47:38

difference is that instead of Phi in

47:40

equation one I've used X M instead of

47:45

using M as the dummy summation term I've

47:49

used ah and I've changed round the x and

47:55

y-coordinates there's no reason why I

47:58

shouldn't do that so now I'm going to

48:00

take the value of DX m which is this

48:03

according to equation 1 and substitute

48:06

it in this equation here and then I'll

48:09

do the same for DX n so what I'm going

48:13

to get is that D s squared is equal to

48:16

Delta MN which is this term here plus

48:19

the summation term which we don't need

48:22

to worry too much about Einstein

48:24

actually dropped it he said it was

48:25

implicit he didn't even bother to put it

48:27

in but I'll just keep it there to show

48:29

that there is a summation going on and

48:31

then instead of DX M I'm going to put

48:34

this term here which is d X M by dy R

48:39

times dy R

48:41

and then we're going to multiply by dxn

48:44

which I'm going to put the equivalent

48:45

version here which is going to be DX and

48:47

by dy I now need another summation term

48:51

call it s times dy s so this term is

48:56

simply this term equals this this term

49:00

is this term modified equals this and

49:04

now I can rearrange that so that I can

49:08

say that D s squared is equal to Delta M

49:11

n we need a summation term let's just

49:14

bring the two gradients together DX M by

49:18

dy r DX n by dy s and that leaves us

49:24

these two terms here dy r dy s and

49:30

that's as it were a form of Pythagoras

49:34

but this term here is called the metric

49:43

tensor it's G M N and if you look you'll

49:48

see that there's an equivalence with

49:50

what we derived up here as pythagoras

49:52

pythagoras was simply the summation term

49:55

with a chronicle delta which made sure

49:57

you didn't get any cross terms here

50:00

we've got exactly the same thing we've

50:02

got d r squared is equal to combination

50:05

of these two elements here but instead

50:08

of having just a simple chronica delta

50:10

we've now got a more complicated metric

50:13

tensor so we can now write that d s

50:17

squared is equal to the metric tensor g

50:21

MN times dy r dy s and of course there's

50:29

a sum a sh gM contains a summation term

50:32

for flat space it's pretty obvious that

50:36

g MN is simply gonna reduce to the

50:39

Kronecker Delta term that should be d m

50:42

n Delta MN so it will be 1 when R equals

50:49

s and it will be 0 when R doesn't equal

50:54

so for flatspace the metric tensor will

50:59

either be 1 or 0 depending on where the

51:03

R equals s or not but here's the rub

51:07

suppose you aren't in flat space in flat

51:10

space it is perfectly true that if

51:16

that's DX 1 and DX 2 and that's d s it

51:20

is true in flat space that D s squared

51:23

equals DX 1 squared plus DX 2 squared

51:28

that's Pythagoras in flat space but that

51:32

is not true if you take a sphere and you

51:38

try to draw a triangle on the surface of

51:41

a sphere on the surface then this

51:46

formula which we derived which is just

51:49

lame Pythagoras that is not true on the

51:53

surface of a sphere and how do you make

51:56

the correction for that surface you make

51:59

the correction by introducing this

52:01

metric tensor so if you like you can

52:04

think of the metric tensor as the device

52:07

which makes corrections to pythagoras

52:11

when you have got the right angle

52:14

triangle on a curved space instead of a

52:19

flat space so you can begin to see the

52:23

value of the metric tensor if we're

52:25

going to talk about curved space-time so

52:28

here is the einstein field equations or

52:31

here are the einstein field equations

52:33

and the g mu nu terms are the metric

52:37

tensors we just derived why have they

52:40

got mu nu instead of em n the answer is

52:43

that you use mu nu when you also include

52:46

space-time what I just derived was

52:49

solely associated with space m and n if

52:52

you want to introduce time as well then

52:56

you say mu nu where mu can now be either

52:59

0 which means that's the time component

53:01

or 1 2 3 which are the three space

53:05

components

53:06

so that is the metric tensor and you may

53:09

now like to take another break okay we

53:13

now proceed to part three the

53:16

Christoffel symbols now you'll remember

53:19

that I said that the important thing

53:21

about tensors was that they represent a

53:23

fixed relationship between two vectors

53:26

and they are independent of the

53:29

coordinate system in particular if one

53:33

tensor is zero in one coordinate system

53:36

it will be zero in all coordinate

53:39

systems so let's suppose that we have a

53:43

tensor it's called it W and we'll take

53:46

the N and M coordinates in the X frame

53:51

of reference and we'll say that that is

53:53

equal to another tensor also with N and

53:57

M coordinates in the X frame of

54:00

reference if that is true in the X frame

54:03

of reference it must be true in all

54:06

frames of reference to take my example

54:10

of the field right at the beginning if

54:12

the height of the field is 2 meters it

54:15

matters not what frame of reference

54:17

you're talking about it will always be 2

54:20

meters but here's the problem the

54:24

problem is that the derivatives of

54:26

tensors do not necessarily transform

54:30

between frames of reference and we're

54:33

going to need derivatives of tensors so

54:36

we need to know what goes wrong so let's

54:40

take a tensor in the X frame of

54:42

reference which we'll call t m in in the

54:46

x frame of reference and let's say that

54:48

that equals the derivative of a vector V

54:55

with respect to N in the X frame of

54:59

reference now the question is does that

55:03

same tensor in the y frame of reference

55:07

equal the derivative of the vector M

55:14

with respect to Y in the Y frame of

55:18

reference is

55:19

that true so the answer is no sadly and

55:23

we'll find out why I'm going back to

55:26

equation five which should appear on the

55:29

screen but I'm just going to rewrite it

55:30

exactly as it was that the tensor T my a

55:36

TM n in the y frame of reference is

55:38

equal to the XR by dy m times DX s by dy

55:48

n times t RS in the x frame of reference

55:55

that was just equation five

55:57

I dropped you'll notice the summation

55:59

term just as Einstein did and the s and

56:03

our terms are dummy variables you need

56:07

to sum over them but let's drop the the

56:09

the summation term well let's just

56:14

rewrite that that is going to be I'm

56:16

just going to rewrite this these terms

56:18

here DX r by dy m times DX s times dy n

56:24

but instead of TR s in the X frame of

56:28

reference I'm going to write use this

56:32

term here but of course in shape I'm

56:34

going to change em and end to R and s so

56:38

this now becomes from the equation above

56:41

D V R X divided by or is it work with

56:49

respect to DX s I've simply written t RS

56:55

in this form here a DV by DX term now if

57:02

you look at that combination of tones

57:06

there you've got what is essentially the

57:08

inverse of the chain rule this is a DX s

57:12

term V is this is a DX s term you can in

57:16

a sense contract this so it simply

57:19

becomes DV R by D Y N and so you get the

57:25

T M and Y which is what we're trying to

57:28

calculate so T MN in the y frame of

57:33

reference is equal to this term here DX

57:37

R by dy M times this contracted which is

57:43

just DB R by D Y so this DV are in the x

57:48

frame of reference / devo dy n and the

57:55

question we want to ask is does that

58:00

equal

58:03

DVM by dy n in the y frame of reference

58:08

so does it equal equal question mark

58:12

does it equal because we don't know

58:14

whether it does DVM in the y frame of

58:18

reference by dy n well what is this term

58:25

DVM by D Y n let's just write that out

58:31

the V M by dy n I'm going to use

58:38

equation 5 which is actually a tensor

58:41

term but remember tensors you can reduce

58:42

two vectors just by dropping one of the

58:44

indices and if you just do it for a

58:47

single index and you can see that dy DV

58:53

M by dy n is actually equal to the

58:58

derivative of with respect to Y n of DX

59:06

r by dy m times V R in the X frame of

59:15

reference that is what DV m by dy n is

59:20

if you take it from Equation number five

59:24

but looking at it only with one index

59:28

but this is a differentiation of a

59:31

product and you should know that if you

59:34

differentiate a product let's

59:35

differentiate a times B then the

59:39

differential of a product will be a

59:40

times D B plus B times D

59:45

a so if this is a and this is B then the

59:50

differential of that differential of a B

59:53

will equal so we've now got that DVM y

59:59

by the Y n which is this term here is

60:02

equal to a DB which is DX R by D Y M

60:10

times DB which is D V R in the X frame

60:17

by dy n that's d B plus B which is V R X

60:27

which will stick out here times da which

60:34

is the combination of these two

60:36

differentials so we've got D by dy n

60:42

times DX R by dy m D that's that

60:49

combination there now observe that this

60:54

term here is equal to this term here TM

61:04

n y equals that term there and we were

61:08

asking does that term there equal this

61:12

term and this term equals yes we've got

61:17

exactly the same answer that we wanted

61:19

those two are exactly the same except

61:23

there's an additional term here so

61:27

actually they are not equal we've got

61:29

this additional thing here and that

61:32

combination of differentials just that

61:37

little combination there is called gamma

61:42

capital gamma it's actually given the

61:45

title the Christoffel symbol and we

61:49

represent the indices that appear here

61:51

by putting since there's an R upstairs

61:54

we'll put an R upstairs and since

61:56

there's an N and an end

61:58

downstairs we'll put an N and the name

62:00

downstairs so that symbol that

62:02

Christoffel symbol that capital gamma is

62:05

simply a shorthand way of writing this

62:08

double differential pair it's the extra

62:12

term that says that those two things are

62:15

not equal in other words let's just make

62:18

it clear what we asked was does TM n in

62:23

the y frame of reference equal DVM by D

62:30

Y N and the answer was no it doesn't

62:36

because there's that extra term and the

62:40

way we get round that extra term is we

62:43

say that t MN y does equal a new concept

62:50

which we will call the covariant

62:52

derivative that's what that symbol means

62:55

of the M so it's not the ordinary

63:01

derivative we shown it was not we're

63:03

gonna call it the covariant derivative

63:05

and what is the covariant derivative

63:07

well the covariant derivative is going

63:10

to be the ordinary derivative the VM by

63:14

dy n which is what we thought it was but

63:18

it wasn't plus the Christoffel symbol

63:22

plus the correction term multiplied by

63:28

the arc ex and so we've now got a

63:37

transformation where you've got

63:38

derivatives which has to include this

63:42

Christoffel symbol it's the extra term

63:45

and I'm gonna call that equation 7 so

63:52

let's put a box around it

63:59

and now we can ask ourselves the

64:02

question so what is this Christoffel

64:05

symbol and it's the compensation for the

64:09

fact that the ordinary derivative of a

64:11

tensor in one frame of reference does

64:14

not transform you need the covariant

64:19

derivative in order that you can get a

64:21

transformation of a derivative of a

64:24

vector which is a part of a tensor and

64:27

that's important because a lot of the

64:30

Einstein field equations required

64:32

derivatives of tensors well we just did

64:36

that using vectors we're going to need

64:38

to expand that for the purposes of

64:40

tensors so let's take the covariant

64:44

derivative I'm going to have to use P

64:47

because I'm going to use M and in in a

64:48

moment because I'm going to do the

64:50

covariant derivative of the tensor T M

64:54

in and that is going to be if you look

64:58

at the equation that we just derived

65:00

which is equation number 7 showing

65:04

essentially if I double that up for two

65:07

indices I'm gonna get the ordinary

65:10

derivative t MN by T y PE you will see

65:16

how that derives from equation seven but

65:20

now I'm going to need to Christoffel

65:22

symbols so I'm going to need one for the

65:27

M element and one for the N element so

65:31

this is going to be plus another

65:37

Christoffel symbol for the M element and

65:47

that's the transformation of a tensor

65:51

from one frame of reference to another

65:54

and we'll call that equation number

65:58

eight

66:04

now what about the covariant derivative

66:07

of the metric tensor that we derived

66:09

earlier let's just remind ourselves what

66:13

the metric tensor was we started off

66:15

with good old Pythagoras

66:17

where this was the X 1 this is the X 2

66:21

this is DS and we say that the S squared

66:24

equals DX 1 squared plus DX 2 all

66:30

squared and we said that you could

66:33

rewrite that as the sum of DX n times DX

66:40

and or if you like you could write that

66:45

as the sum of DX m DX n times the

66:50

Kronecker Delta M n where remember the

66:53

Kronecker Delta was 1 when M equals n

66:58

and it was 0 when M does not equal n and

67:01

we said that on flat space that is

67:06

essentially G MN for flat space it's not

67:11

true for curved space indeed that's the

67:13

reason you have the metric tensor G MN

67:16

it corrects Pythagoras for curved space

67:19

now what is the derivative we'll call it

67:24

the covariant derivative of G MN let's

67:28

say with respect to R in the X frame of

67:33

reference if we are talking about flat

67:36

space well in flat space the metric

67:42

tensor is either 1 or it is 0 it is a

67:46

constant so the covariant derivative of

67:49

a constant in flat space is 0 but what

67:54

did I tell you about derivatives of

67:56

tensors if you've got a value of 0 in

68:01

one frame of reference then you've got a

68:04

value of 0 in all frames of reference so

68:07

consequently the derivative of the

68:10

metric tensor

68:12

well the covariant derivative of the

68:14

metric tensor will

68:15

zero in all frames of reference which

68:20

means if we take this formula up here

68:23

equation number eight and replace just

68:27

write it down again but put T sorry put

68:31

G in in place of all the t's we will

68:34

have a transformation and or a value of

68:39

the covariant derivative of G in terms

68:42

of all these terms but the covariant of

68:45

G of course always equals zero so if we

68:49

replace T's by G's then this all becomes

68:53

zero so let's just do it I'm going to

68:55

take equation number eight and I'm

68:57

simply going to write it out again

68:59

exactly as it was but this time I'm

69:02

going to substitute G for all the t's so

69:06

I'm going to get DG m n by d YP plus the

69:13

Christoffel symbol p.m. and R of G are n

69:19

plus the Christoffel symbol P n R of G M

69:26

R and well I can now tell you is that

69:30

that the covariant derivative equals

69:33

zero so I can put that as zero and now

69:37

I've got an equation which has got the

69:41

metric tensor in it and a derivative of

69:45

the metric tensor and the Christoffel

69:48

symbol so I ought to be able to

69:50

rearrange that equation so that I can

69:53

express the Christoffel symbol in terms

69:56

of the metric tensor now for that you

69:59

need a mathematician so you go along to

70:01

your friendly mathematical professor and

70:03

I daresay Einstein did the same and he

70:06

will tell you that if you've got a

70:09

Christoffel symbol with just a B and C

70:13

then that is going to be equal to take a

70:17

deep breath 1/2 G a de where D is an

70:24

additional term it becomes an additional

70:25

summation term

70:28

to the derivative of G DC / DX B or by

70:36

DX B + remember the mathematicians come

70:39

up with this so we naturally take their

70:42

word for it - I hope this is going to

70:47

fit in

70:47

d G BC by DX D and I'll call that

70:58

equation 9 and what you've got courtesy

71:04

of the mathematicians is you've taken

71:06

this term which we ourselves managed to

71:11

derive you've jiggled in about so that

71:14

you've got because it equals zero

71:16

you've got the gamma terms the

71:18

Christoffel terms expressed in terms of

71:21

the metric tensor and first derivatives

71:24

of the metric tensor so what can you say

71:29

about this Christoffel symbol firstly

71:32

it's not itself a tensor it's in the

71:35

sense it's a correction term Christoffel

71:38

symbol will be equal to zero in flat

71:41

space but it won't be equal to zero in

71:46

curvilinear time space or space time and

71:50

you'll also notice that it can be

71:52

expressed wholly in terms of the metric

71:55

tensor and the first derivatives of big

71:58

metric tensor and you might ask yourself

72:01

why have we spent all this time trying

72:05

to find a thing called a Christoffel

72:07

symbol when it doesn't even feature in

72:11

the einstein field equations you will

72:13

not see a Christoffel symbol in that

72:15

equation in those equations the answer's

72:19

no you won't but that's because the

72:21

Christoffel symbol is buried in the

72:23

Ricci curvature tensor and that's what

72:26

we're going on to next but first I think

72:29

it's possibly time for another break ok

72:34

so now we come on to curvature if we're

72:37

going to talk about curved space time

72:39

we've ever

72:40

understand what curvature means let us

72:43

take a path in flat space flat space

72:47

fell flat space-time my paper is flat

72:51

what you do is you take a vector a

72:54

vector of course will have magnitude and

72:58

direction and what you do is you what's

73:01

called parallel transport it around the

73:04

path that means you keep the same length

73:08

of vector and you keep it oriented in

73:11

the same way so it travels parallel to

73:13

itself so all of those lines are

73:16

intended to be my drawing may not make

73:19

it quite so obvious but they are

73:21

intended to be the same length and all

73:24

of the vectors are parallel so they just

73:28

keep parallel for themselves until you

73:31

get back to where you started and of

73:33

course when you get back to where you

73:35

started your vector will be of the same

73:37

length and it will be in the same

73:39

direction because it's always moved

73:43

parallel to itself so it will come back

73:45

to where it started okay all very well

73:49

and good but now let's take a code here

73:57

is a cone which I have made for

73:59

illustration purposes as you can see

74:03

it's curved cone but I can do is I can

74:07

cut down the side of the cone and open

74:11

it up so if I make a cut along one line

74:14

I can then open the cone up and if he

74:17

comes flat and it has that kind of shape

74:21

so let me recreate the cone I just bring

74:24

those two lines together when it's a

74:27

cone that edge is joined up so in a

74:32

sense this edge here and this edge here

74:35

are the same line the same point on the

74:39

cone so let's just draw what the code

74:44

looks like when you open it up you cut

74:47

down this point here and you open it up

74:53

and you get a shape that looks like it's

74:57

a circle but with a slice taken out of

75:01

it that's the cone just a quick reminder

75:03

there is the cone and remember that the

75:07

line o ay and the line OB when they are

75:12

in a cone are the same line it's that

75:15

dotted line now I'm going to do a bit of

75:19

parallel transporting and to remember

75:22

where the vector was let me just take

75:24

that V out of the way and put it there

75:26

a B I'm going to have a vector which

75:31

continues the line OB so just a straight

75:35

continuation and now I'm going to

75:38

parallel transport that vector around

75:41

the cone remember it stays the same

75:47

length though mine may not it always

75:49

stays parallel and we keep going until

75:52

we get to a and we stop because a is

76:00

point B remember they are the same

76:03

points on the cone but what has happened

76:06

well the length of the vector is the

76:09

same but the direction of the vector has

76:13

changed

76:14

you can tell it's changed direction

76:16

because I started it as being an

76:18

extension of the line OB and OB is the

76:22

same as the line o a remember it's this

76:24

dotted line here so if the vector were

76:28

to be in the same direction it should

76:31

end up like that but it didn't he ended

76:35

up like this it's gone through an angle

76:38

so although the length has remained the

76:41

same the direction of the vector has

76:44

changed and that is a measure of

76:47

curvature if you parallel transport a

76:50

vector around a surface and you don't

76:54

get back and you get back to the same

76:56

position remember position a is position

76:59

B you get back to the same point but the

77:02

vector has changed direction then you've

77:05

gone round occur

77:06

so that's how we're going to define

77:08

curvature an angle change in the vector

77:11

when you parallel transport it

77:14

transported around a surface if it's a

77:17

flat surface as we showed no change in

77:20

direction if there's a curved surface it

77:23

changes direction now I'm just going to

77:25

take a slight diversion and a pause to

77:28

deal with two definitions the first is

77:32

what's called a commutator commutator

77:36

czar written like this square brackets a

77:38

and B and all that means is a B minus B

77:44

a a times B minus B times a now of

77:48

course if we are simply talking about

77:50

pure numbers then that will equal 0 3

77:54

times 2 minus 2 times 3 is 0 the point

77:59

about commutator is they don't always

78:01

equal 0 and I'm particularly going to

78:05

look at one which is the commutator of D

78:09

by DX and some function of X that's my

78:14

commutator and I'm going to show that

78:18

that actually equals D FX divided by DX

78:23

it doesn't equal 0 so let's just do a

78:27

quick proof remember that the commutator

78:30

is a B minus B a so it's going to be

78:34

that times that minus that times that so

78:39

let's just write that out that's going

78:41

to be d by DX of F X minus FX times D by

78:52

DX now you've got to apply a D by DX to

78:56

something so let's just call it V but

79:03

here we've got the differentiation of a

79:06

product and just as we did before we can

79:08

say that D a B is equal to BD a plus a

79:15

DB doesn't matter which way around you

79:18

do it

79:19

differential of a product BD a plus a DB

79:23

where this is a and this is B so

79:26

consequently this term here using this

79:30

formula here will equal B which is V

79:33

times da which is D FX by the X plus a

79:44

which is FX times DB DV v DX that is

79:54

that term and we must remember that term

79:56

there which is minus FX DV by DX and

80:01

you'll see that that term and that term

80:04

are equal so one minus the other is zero

80:08

and you're left with V times DF x times

80:11

DX well V is something we simply

80:13

inserted so we can now take that out and

80:16

now you've got that the commutator is

80:20

equal to DF X by DX which is what we

80:23

wanted to show in the first place so

80:25

let's now take two coordinates which do

80:30

not necessarily have to be right angles

80:32

this is the X mu of coordinate this is

80:36

the X new coordinate and I'm going to

80:40

have a distance which I'm going to call

80:42

DX mu and I'm gonna have a distance this

80:46

way which is DX new so a distance DX mu

80:50

in the X view coordinate system and a

80:53

distance DX new in the X new Co ordinate

80:57

what I'm going to do is construct a

80:59

parallelogram from that so essentially

81:02

it's going to be a parallelogram where

81:06

the length of these two are going to be

81:10

DX mu and that's the same there and the

81:16

length of these two sides D X new so far

81:23

so good and now I'm going to do a

81:26

parallel transport around this path

81:30

we're going to go from a

81:33

to B to C to D and back to a again but

81:37

I'm going to call the return point

81:39

a-prime because I'm not sure that we're

81:43

going to get back the victor will be

81:44

exactly the same when it gets to a prime

81:46

so the vector at a prime may not be the

81:49

same as the vector at a if we have gone

81:52

round a curved surface now let's just

81:56

take two paths consider two parts the

81:59

first is VC minus VD that's the

82:05

essentially what we're talking about

82:06

there is the difference between the

82:08

vector at Point C and the vector at

82:11

Point D and compare that with the vector

82:16

at point B and the vector at Point a now

82:24

if we are going around a flat surface

82:28

then the C minus PD will equal VB minus

82:34

VA and that whole term will equal zero

82:38

but what this is actually representing

82:40

is the differences in the D mu direction

82:45

because it's that's the or the DX mu

82:48

direction because that's the directions

82:52

that we're moving here similarly if you

82:57

take the C minus V B which is this path

83:03

here minus VD minus VA prime you get the

83:11

difference in the DX new direction

83:18

because that's that path there and that

83:20

path there they're parallel in flat

83:23

space there would be no difference but

83:25

in curved space there might be and

83:27

you're now looking at the difference in

83:29

the D new direction now let's have a

83:32

look at the difference of the

83:34

differences if we take this term here

83:37

and we subtract from it this term here

83:44

what do we get

83:46

well let's have a look at the VB term

83:49

we've got a minus VB and the minus minus

83:53

VB that becomes plus so we get a minus

83:56

plus zero we get no resultant VB term

84:00

then took an pc we've got a plus VC

84:04

minus VC the VC term goes BD we've got a

84:09

minus VD minus a minus VD so it's plus

84:13

minus plus the VD term goes as well what

84:18

about VA we've got a minus minus so that

84:22

becomes a plus so we've got VA and then

84:26

we've got for VA prime we've got a minus

84:29

minus minus so three minuses make a

84:32

minor so that becomes minus V a prime

84:35

and that's the difference of differences

84:39

that's going to be the change in the

84:41

vector as it is parallel transported

84:44

around that parallelogram as I say in

84:48

flat space no problem DV will be zero

84:51

because there won't be any change it

84:52

will just parallel transport round it

84:55

will come back to the same magnitude and

84:57

the same direction but it is in curved

84:59

space there will be a difference not in

85:03

length but in angle of the vector now

85:07

let's take this first term here VC minus

85:09

VD what actually is that well that is

85:12

the change as the vector goes from C to

85:16

D along a distance DX mu so VC minus VD

85:24

is simply the change in the vector along

85:31

the distance X mu multi multiplied by

85:38

the distance you travel which of course

85:40

is DX mu multiplied of course by the

85:42

vector itself so what we're saying is

85:45

that the change in the vector between C

85:48

and D is the gradient remember we did

85:53

this right at the beginning with our

85:54

field the gradient multiplied by the

85:58

distance times of course the

86:00

value of the vector but we've just

86:03

learned that we need to be very careful

86:04

about ordinary derivatives when you're

86:07

talking about curves you need to use the

86:10

covariant derivative so actually to be

86:13

more accurate we better call this the

86:15

covariant derivative so instead of using

86:17

this gradient we're going to use the

86:20

covariant derivative times DX mu that's

86:23

this term here times the value of the

86:25

vector that's a much healthier way of

86:28

doing it because we've just learned that

86:30

you have to be very careful about

86:31

ordinary derivatives when you're

86:33

transforming between different reference

86:35

systems now what is this term

86:38

BC - VD minus VB minus VA that is the

86:43

difference in the differences on on a

86:49

line which is separated by the distance

86:52

DX nu so essentially what you're doing

86:56

is you're looking at the difference of

86:57

vectors with a separation of DX nu which

87:01

means you have to apply a new gradient

87:04

to it so VC minus VD minus VB minus VA

87:11

which is this term here which is as I

87:15

said the difference in the vectors in

87:18

those two lines separated by different

87:21

distance DX nu well we said that VC

87:26

minus VD is the covariant derivative

87:32

times the distance times all that sorry

87:34

not knew that V times the value of the

87:36

vector but the difference is essentially

87:40

another differential and it's the

87:42

differential in the new direction so

87:45

we've now got to add covariant

87:49

derivative in the new direction times

87:51

the distance away so that is effectively

87:55

what that difference that difference

88:00

equals what about this one here

88:04

well this one will just be the opposite

88:08

in other words VC minus VB minus V

88:14

\- VA prime is just gonna be well VC

88:19

minus VB will be the covariant

88:23

derivative but this time in the new

88:24

direction so now we need covariant

88:28

direction in the new direction times DX

88:30

nu times the value of the vector but

88:34

this subtraction means that you're

88:36

looking at the difference between this

88:39

line and this line separated by DX mu so

88:43

you're essentially applying another

88:45

differential but this time in that mu

88:47

direction so we've now got that that

88:52

term is essentially that term and this

88:56

term is essentially this term and what

88:59

we said was that if you subtract that or

89:03

if you subtract that term from that term

89:05

you get VA minus V prime a prime which

89:08

is the difference in the vector the

89:12

difference between the vector at the

89:13

starting point and the vector at the end

89:15

point so if you subtract this term from

89:20

this term you're going to get DV the

89:24

difference in the vectors so let's write

89:27

it out DV is going to be equal to that

89:32

term minus that term which is gamma nu

89:38

sorry a very derivative new covariant

89:41

derivative mu doesn't matter which order

89:44

we put these in DX nu DX mu V minus this

89:51

term covariant derivative mu covariant

89:55

derivative nu DX mu DX nu V and we can

90:02

pull out the DX nu DX mu and V because

90:05

author again doesn't matter here so that

90:08

becomes DX mu DX nu V into what's left

90:16

which is covariant new covariant mu

90:21

minus covariant mu covariant nu

90:25

and that you'll recognize of course is

90:28

simply the definition of commutator

90:35

which is of course simply Delta Nu comma

90:38

Delta mu not Delta's covariant

90:43

derivatives off but you'll remember that

90:46

from Equation seven the covariant

90:51

derivative is equal to the ordinary

90:55

derivative incidentally when I write D

90:57

nu like that what I really mean is D by

91:00

the X nu it's just a shorthand plus a

91:04

gamma term I won't write out the full

91:06

details of it but there was a gamma term

91:08

remember that was the correcting term

91:11

the Christoffel symbol term so wherever

91:15

we have this covariant form

91:18

we'll remember from Equation 7 that the

91:21

covariant form is the ordinary

91:23

derivative plus this correcting term

91:25

which involves the Christoffel symbol so

91:29

on that basis the commutator of which we

91:35

identified before is going to be equal

91:39

that times that minus that times that

91:43

that's what a commutator is but remember

91:46

that the covariant derivative is the

91:49

ordinary derivative times the assorting

91:51

plus the Christoffel term so we now get

91:55

that that is equivalent to this term is

92:01

d nu plus a Christoffel symbol

92:04

associated with nu times this term which

92:08

is the d mu plus the Christoffel symbol

92:11

associated with mu minus this term times

92:20

this term

92:25

I hope you can see that and let's just

92:34

multiply that all out so we've got a D

92:37

nu times D mu term then we've got a

92:44

gamma nu times D mu then we've got a

92:53

Dinu times gamma mu and finally we've

93:00

got a gamma nu gamma mu and that's that

93:07

all multiplied out from that we have to

93:11

subtract this term

93:16

well let's multiply that out we've got a

93:17

d mu times d nu those should be curly DS

93:23

by the way all of these should be curly

93:25

DS plus we've got a D mu gamma nu term

93:37

then we've got a gamma mu D nu term

93:42

and finally we've got a gamma mu gamma

93:47

nu term right let's do the subtractions

93:52

D nu D mu minus D mu D nu is equal to 0

93:58

because for ordinary derivatives the

94:01

order doesn't matter gamma nu D mu minus

94:06

D mu gamma nu will let a commutator in

94:10

fact that is equal to the minus the

94:12

commutator of D mu gamma nu gamma nu D

94:18

nu is equal to minus the commutator of D

94:21

nu gamma nu we've got another commutator

94:26

here D nu gamma mu minus gamma nu D nu

94:30

well that's just the commutator of D nu

94:34

gamma mu

94:37

then we've got gamma nu gamma mu minus

94:42

gamma mu gamma nu and that again is

94:46

going to be the commutator of whoops the

94:49

commutator of gamma nu gamma mu so just

94:56

remind you that was the commutator of

94:59

the two covariant vectors here or two

95:02

covariant terms here becomes this term

95:06

here but you may remember when I took

95:10

that diversion to talk about commutator

95:13

z' I said that if you have a function

95:15

like that that equals the derivative of

95:20

the gamma term with respect to X mu and

95:27

this becomes the derivative of the gamma

95:30

term with respect to X nu and this

95:37

entire term is called the Riemann tensor

95:46

and you'll notice that it is made up of

95:51

Christoffel symbols and derivatives of

95:55

Christoffel symbols it's called the

95:58

Riemann tensor I can tell you that for

96:02

our purposes it is also and can be

96:06

regarded as the Ricci tensor which we

96:10

need and that's why we needed to derive

96:12

the Christoffel symbols because as you

96:14

can see the Ricci tensor contains

96:17

Christoffel symbols and derivatives of

96:20

Christoffel symbols and the Ricci tensor

96:23

remember was the first term in the

96:26

Einstein field equations which I'm

96:28

showing you now just to remind you so

96:32

what we've just shown is that the change

96:34

in the vector remember the angle of

96:36

vector rather than the length is equal

96:38

to DX mu DX nu times V times the

96:44

commutator covariant nu

96:49

covariant Moo and that term we said was

96:55

the Riemann tensor but for our purposes

96:58

it's also the Ricci tensor so let's just

97:04

take stock of where we've got to we've

97:06

just shown that the Ricci tensor is made

97:09

up of Christoffel symbols and the

97:12

derivatives of Christoffel symbols but

97:16

what our Christoffel symbols will go

97:19

back to equation 9 and you see that

97:22

Christoffel symbols are made up of

97:24

metric tensors and the derivatives of

97:28

metric tensors and what are metric

97:32

tensors they can be thought of as the

97:35

device that you need to correct for

97:39

Pythagoras on a curved surface now what

97:43

I can also tell you is that from the

97:45

Ricci tensor arm you knew you can derive

97:49

what is called a curvature scalar it is

97:53

simply a scalar it is not a tensor not a

97:55

vector at just a scalar just as for

97:58

example if you take the dot product of

98:00

two vectors you get the scalar you can

98:03

take the Ricci tensor and from it you

98:07

can create a curvature scalar the point

98:09

about that is if the curvature scalar is

98:12

not zero then the surface is not flat

98:17

okay let's just review where we've got

98:19

to we've covered the metric tensor G mu

98:22

nu we've covered the Ricci tensor R mu

98:25

nu which includes a lot of Christoffel

98:27

symbols we've covered the curvature

98:30

scalar R and so we've covered most of

98:36

mine Stein's

98:37

field equations there are just two more

98:40

terms to go the stress energy momentum

98:43

tensor T mu nu and the cosmological

98:46

constant capital lambda but first time

98:51

for another break okay we're now ready

98:54

to do the stress energy momentum tensor

98:56

T mu nu what is the shortest distance

99:00

between two

99:03

answer a straight line what is the

99:07

shortest distance between two points say

99:10

on the surface of a sphere not two

99:14

points on a circle but two points on the

99:16

surface of a sphere the answer is the

99:19

shortest distance is what is called a

99:21

geodesic and on a sphere on the earth

99:26

for example the equator is a geodesic

99:28

any line of longitude is a geodesic the

99:33

shortest distance between two points

99:35

where you have to go round the curve you

99:38

can't go in a straight line is called a

99:40

geodesic and we can define what's called

99:43

a tangent vector DX mu by D tau as a

99:51

rate of change of the distance that we

99:55

travel with respect to time I'm using

99:57

tau because tau is what's called proper

100:00

time you can find out what proper time

100:02

is from my videos on special relativity

100:05

the important point about proper time is

100:08

it is the time which all observers no

100:11

matter what frame of reference therein

100:12

can agree on

100:14

so if we use tau we know that there can

100:17

be no arguments about what we mean so

100:19

we're looking about the rate of change

100:21

of distance with time and that's called

100:25

a tangent vector and what we want to say

100:27

is that the derivative of that tangent

100:30

vector must equal zero in order to find

100:34

the minimum distance so generally

100:38

speaking if you want to find the minimum

100:40

in a curve you take the derivative you

100:42

take thee and you set that derivative

100:44

equal to zero and that will give you the

100:46

minimum it also gives you incidentally

100:48

the maximum but in this case we're

100:50

talking about the minimum so if you take

100:54

the derivative of the tangent vector and

100:56

set it to zero you will get as it were

100:59

the path for the geodesic the shortest

101:03

distance now when I say take the

101:06

derivative remember we must always be

101:08

cautious about derivatives in in general

101:10

relativity we've already learned that

101:13

can come a cropper if we take ordinary

101:14

derivatives we need to go for the

101:16

covariant derivative so let's take the

101:20

covariant derivative of this tangent

101:22

vector DX mu by D tau and from Equation

101:28

7 which should be on the screen you can

101:31

see that that will essentially be the

101:33

ordinary derivative plus a gamma term

101:41

which I won't fill out but there is a

101:44

gamma term remember that's the

101:46

correcting term and what we can say is

101:49

for the geodesic this term must equal

101:52

zero so you've got this term Plus this

101:59

term equals zero let's look at this term

102:03

here this is essentially a double

102:06

differential with respect to time it is

102:09

if you like D to X mu D tau squared what

102:19

does that look like

102:20

isn't that acceleration the rate of

102:24

change of the rate of change of distance

102:27

with time D to X by DT squared is

102:30

acceleration and that equals well if

102:34

that Plus that equals naught this equals

102:37

minus the gamma term well what does that

102:42

look like let's remember that general

102:46

relativity and Newton's law of

102:49

gravitation need to be the same when

102:53

you're just talking about ordinary

102:55

masses ordinary speeds low speeds

102:59

you're not talking a black about black

103:01

holes because Newton's law of

103:03

gravitation very nicely describes what

103:07

appears to be gravity and so in the

103:10

simple case general relativity and

103:13

Newton's law must conform to the same

103:17

thing Newton's law says that force is

103:20

mass times acceleration or if you like

103:24

that acceleration

103:26

is a force term divided by mass and here

103:31

we've got an acceleration is equal to

103:34

minus a gamma term so what we can say is

103:38

that that gamma term is the equivalent

103:42

of force in Newton's laws and there'll

103:48

be a mass term in it as well but mass is

103:50

constant so let's forget about that this

103:52

gamma term this Christoffel symbol has a

103:55

kind of broad equivalence to force now

103:58

to save time I just rewritten equation

104:02

nine that we derived for the Christoffel

104:04

symbol remember we said that it consists

104:07

of metric tensor plus derivatives of the

104:11

metric tensor now let's consider a

104:14

situation where we're talking about low

104:17

gravity low speed we're not in black

104:19

holes we're not anything like that is

104:21

just ordinary space slow movement

104:24

general relativity must reduce to no to

104:28

Newtonian gravity when that happens G

104:33

becomes 1 and the derivative terms are

104:39

very very small with one exception and

104:43

that is the time term and time remember

104:48

has mu and nu equal to 0 so the DG 0 0 0

104:55

by DX time component is the only term in

105:00

the derivatives that has any

105:02

significance all the rest when you're

105:05

talking about slow speed small masses no

105:08

black holes all these other terms are

105:10

very very small the only one that has

105:13

any significance is the time term and

105:15

this term G becomes 1 and so that gamma

105:20

term reduces to 1/2 that G becomes 1 so

105:25

we can ignore that multiplied by all of

105:28

this lot which is simply DG 0 0 0 by DX

105:34

and that we said was

105:38

equivalent to a force term so the force

105:41

is kind of equivalent to this term here

105:44

but in Newtonian mechanics force is

105:48

minus the derivative of the potential

105:54

for example if the potential energy near

105:58

the earth is equal to mg X where X is

106:02

the height above the earth then the

106:05

force it will usually be given as minus

106:08

mg X of course then the force will be

106:11

minus D Phi by the X which equals minus

106:16

mg the minus term simply indicates that

106:21

the force is acting in one direction

106:23

that X is measured in the other

106:25

direction

106:25

so all I'm showing here is that in

106:28

Newtonian mechanics force is minus the

106:32

derivative of the potential now we just

106:36

show that the Christoffel symbol capital

106:39

gamma is the equivalent of a force term

106:43

and in ordinary space where we're not

106:47

anywhere near black holes that it

106:50

equalled the derivative of the time

106:52

component of the metric tensor with

106:54

respect to X and we've also just shown

106:57

that force is minus the potential or the

107:04

derivative of the potential with respect

107:06

to X and so we can see that if gamma is

107:10

a force term that these two terms are

107:14

broadly equivalent and thus you get that

107:18

G naught naught is equal to 2 Phi plus a

107:24

constant from the integration that you

107:27

need to do but you can forget all about

107:28

the constant because as soon as we

107:30

differentiate again that constant will

107:32

go there is probably a minus sign in

107:35

there somewhere but we don't need to

107:37

worry too much about that either we're

107:38

looking at the principle here what we're

107:40

saying is that because the Christoffel

107:42

symbol equals that and Christoffel

107:45

symbol has a kind of force equivalence

107:47

and in Newtonian mechanics force is

107:50

equal to minus that if

107:52

Rachele of the potential energy that you

107:55

can therefore equate these two terms and

107:57

if you equate those two terms

107:59

essentially the metric tensor or the

108:02

time value of the metric tensor is equal

108:06

to two times the potential energy plus a

108:09

constant now we said that force is minus

108:14

D Phi sorry is minus D Phi by DX but of

108:17

course we really need to do that in

108:19

three dimensions and so that normally

108:22

reduces to what is called the divergence

108:25

of Phi where the divergence term is

108:29

simply a D by DX plus a D by dy plus a D

108:35

by DZ D term and that of course should

108:41

be minus there but we also know from

108:45

Newton's law of gravitation that the

108:47

force is equal to minus G the

108:50

gravitational constant times the mass of

108:53

one object times the mass of the object

108:55

other object divided by the square of

108:57

the distance between them so let's

109:02

consider an object of mass M and let's

109:07

consider a distance R from mass M and we

109:13

ask ourselves the question what is the

109:15

force acting on a unit mass place a

109:19

distance R from M well if the unit mass

109:23

that means the unit mass is 1 the force

109:26

will be minus G M over R squared because

109:32

M is 1 what is therefore the force

109:35

capability across the whole of that

109:39

surface of that sphere well that's going

109:44

to be the integral of F da where da is

109:48

the area of the surface of the sphere

109:52

and that's going to be the integral of

109:56

the force which is minus GM over R

110:00

squared times da

110:04

well if you integrate out that of course

110:07

is simply going to be equal to minus GM

110:09

over R squared times times the entire

110:14

area of the surface of that sphere of

110:17

radius R which is 4 PI R squared the R

110:22

Squared's cancel and so you find that

110:25

that reduces to minus GM times 4 pi now

110:31

there is a theorem called the divergence

110:33

theorem which I won't derive but you can

110:36

look it up I'll write it out first

110:38

it says that the integral of F Da over

110:41

an area is equal to the integral over

110:45

the volume of Dell F DV and what that

110:51

means in layman's terms is that the

110:54

outward flux through the area of a

110:57

sphere is equal to the volume integral

111:00

of the divergence of the force that's

111:04

just a divergence theorem that can be

111:06

derived and you can look it up I also

111:09

just want to remind you that density is

111:11

mass divided by volume and that

111:15

therefore you can say that the mass of

111:17

an object will be the integral of the

111:19

density with respect to volume so now

111:24

I'm going to take F da which we

111:28

calculated to be this term and set it

111:30

equal to this term so you've now got

111:33

that F dot Da is four pi G times M or

111:38

more accurately minus four PI G times M

111:44

but for M I'm going to use the integral

111:47

of Rho DV density times volume

111:52

that's F da or more accurately this the

111:58

integral of F dot Da

112:00

and that's going to be the integral of

112:02

the volume of DF DV or del F DV the

112:09

divergence of F well although it's not

112:14

really proper to do it you can cancel

112:16

out the D V's

112:17

essentially what you're left with is

112:19

that del F the divergence of F is equal

112:25

to four PI G Rev actually minus four PI

112:31

G unfortunately I had a camera failure

112:33

for the next section so I'm just

112:35

repeating the flow of the argument we've

112:38

shown that the force is minus the

112:40

derivative of the potential in Newtonian

112:43

mechanics we've also just shown that the

112:47

derivative of the force is equal to

112:50

minus four PI G low consequently if the

112:55

force is minus the derivative of Phi the

113:00

derivative of force is the derivative of

113:03

minus the derivative of Phi and that

113:06

equals minus four PI G Rho in other

113:10

words minus the derivative squared of

113:14

Phi B potential equals four PI G Rho the

113:19

minuses on both sides cancel earlier we

113:25

showed that the time component of the

113:29

metric tensor G zero zero equals twice

113:33

the potential plus a constant which

113:37

means that the potential is 1/2 the

113:41

metric tensor I've dropped the constant

113:44

that you'll see there's no problem

113:45

without doing so because as soon as you

113:47

do do a derivative of Phi derivative

113:52

squared of Phi which is this term here

113:58

replacing Phi by 1/2 G zero zero the

114:02

constants will all go of course so now

114:05

you've got that the derivative squared

114:07

of Phi is four PI G Rho so the

114:10

derivative squared of half the time

114:13

component the metric tensor equals four

114:16

PI G Rho and if you multiply both sides

114:20

of the equation by two you get that the

114:26

derivative squared of the metric tensor

114:29

equals eight pi

114:31

gee ro the problem with that is it's not

114:35

a tensor equation and for general

114:39

relativity we need tensor equations so

114:42

what we're looking for is something that

114:45

looks similar to it but we're on the

114:48

left hand side of the equation you've

114:49

got a tensor and on the right-hand side

114:53

of the equation you've got tensor so we

114:55

want something that has the form of G mu

114:58

nu which is actually called Einsteins

115:00

tensor is equal to 8 pi G but instead of

115:05

having the mass density term Rho we want

115:09

a tensor for energy something that

115:13

contains all the mass energy stress

115:16

pressure terms that you can have so

115:19

we've essentially got to find something

115:21

for this and something for that let's

115:23

look at the T mu nu side of it first if

115:27

you go back to my video on special

115:30

relativity e equals mc-squared

115:32

part 5 and go to the point in the video

115:35

which is 2 minutes and 10 seconds in

115:38

you'll find that we derive what is

115:40

called a momentum four-vector the four

115:44

vectors of course one dimension of time

115:47

three dimensions of space and you'll

115:50

find that we defined that momentum

115:52

four-vector as being mass multiplied by

115:55

X naught over tau X 1 over tau X 2 over

116:02

tau and X 3 over tau and this is simply

116:07

obviously that's the time component the

116:09

X component the Y component and the Z

116:12

component in the four dimensions of

116:15

space-time divided by tau the proper

116:18

time the time that everybody agrees and

116:21

what we showed was that if you reduce

116:24

this term you get essentially an MC

116:27

squared which is energy e equals MC

116:31

squared and these terms all effectively

116:35

become the momentum in the different

116:40

coordinates

116:42

so it's MV in the x-direction MV in the

116:45

y-direction and MV in the same direction

116:48

so this for momentum reduces out to

116:52

basic rest mass energy plus momenta in

116:56

the three coordinates of space well

117:00

that's fine but that is just of course

117:02

essentially a vector we need a tensor we

117:07

need not P that T mu nu and that means

117:12

we need a four by four matrix and to

117:16

save time I've drawn one and there it is

117:19

you will see that T has all the values

117:22

of mu and nu from naught to 3 and what

117:27

do all these values mean well the top

117:30

one T naught naught that is going to be

117:32

the time component of the of the of the

117:37

energy stress energy momentum tensor and

117:39

that has this kind of equivalence it's

117:42

the energy part of the tensor the three

117:48

components along the top here I want to

117:50

call the energy flow parts of the tensor

117:53

the three components here I want to call

117:57

the momentum density of the tensor and

118:00

the nine components which are left are

118:03

essentially the momentum flux stress

118:07

pressure parts of the tensor now those

118:09

we are embodying every part of energy

118:13

that we can think of whether it be pure

118:15

energy rest mass energy momentum stress

118:18

all of it somehow finds a place in this

118:22

stress energy momentum tensor it is if

118:27

you like a measure of energy per unit

118:30

volume now energy has the same units as

118:35

work so we can think of this as work per

118:37

unit volume work is Force Times distance

118:41

distance is a length volume is a length

118:45

cubed so that's equivalent force divided

118:48

by a length squared which is force over

118:51

area which is of course the units of

118:54

pressure

118:55

so that's how energy per unit volume can

118:58

also embrace pressure or stress so

119:03

that's given us we can't derive it but

119:06

I'm trying to illustrate how we get here

119:08

that's given us a stress energy momentum

119:11

tensor with 16 different terms some of

119:16

which it turns out are duplicates it

119:18

comes in the form of a matrix it

119:21

embodies all forms of energy and it's

119:25

the stress energy momentum tensor that

119:27

we use on the right-hand side of the

119:29

Einstein field equation so now we've got

119:33

on the right-hand side we've got the 8

119:36

pi G that we derived but we're going to

119:39

replace the density term that we came up

119:42

with with this new stress energy

119:45

momentum tensor and we're going to have

119:49

something on the left-hand side now what

119:51

could it be this is as it were the mass

119:54

term on this side we need something that

119:57

is the space-time curvature term so

120:00

Einstein thought that the obvious

120:02

candidate for it would be the Ricci

120:04

curvature tensor ah mutant ooh but

120:09

there's a problem the problem is that we

120:13

have a thing called energy conservation

120:15

energy can be neither created nor

120:17

destroyed so if you take the derivative

120:20

of the energy tensor it should be zero

120:25

there is no change in energy the problem

120:31

is if you take the derivative of the

120:34

Ricci tensor it does not equal zero so

120:39

that equation can't be true because the

120:42

derivative one side would be zero the

120:45

derivative of the other side would not a

120:47

bear in mind that we must always when

120:51

we're talking about general relativity

120:53

and field equations never do ordinary

120:56

derivatives you will come unstuck we

120:59

must always use the covariant derivative

121:01

so if we've got that the covariant

121:03

derivative of the energy side is zero

121:08

we need something on the left-hand side

121:10

whose derivative will equal zero

121:14

now what Einstein actually found was

121:16

that the covariant derivative of the

121:20

Ricci tensor was not zero but it

121:24

actually was one half times the

121:26

covariant derivative of the metric

121:30

tensor times the curvature scalar which

121:34

we spoke about earlier have you got an

121:38

equation like that you can bring

121:40

everything to one side and essentially

121:43

you get that the covariant derivative of

121:46

the Ricci tensor minus half times the

121:51

metric tensor times the curvature scalar

121:54

equals zero and now we've got a

121:58

covariant derivative of the term which

122:01

equals zero we've got the covariant

122:05

derivative of t MV equals zero and the

122:09

covariant derivative of this term equals

122:11

zero therefore that term and that term

122:14

must be equivalent and so we've now got

122:18

a left-hand side of the equation R mu nu

122:23

minus 1/2 G mu nu times R equals the

122:29

right-hand side of the equation when

122:30

it's not just team you knew of course

122:32

it's 8 pi G T mu nu and we're almost

122:42

there

122:42

it turns out four dimensional purposes

122:44

you need to have a C to the fourth term

122:47

here but that's essentially just a

122:50

constant for dimensional purposes but

122:53

Einstein realized he'd forgotten

122:55

something

122:56

you remember that earlier we showed that

122:57

the covariant derivative of the metric

123:01

tensor equals zero because it did it in

123:05

one frame and therefore it must do it in

123:07

all frames and therefore we could have

123:10

included the we could have included the

123:14

metric tensor in this equation here not

123:17

just as a multiplier of R but in its own

123:20

right

123:21

and of course we could have included it

123:23

with any constant in front of it so

123:26

Einstein therefore decided that you

123:30

needed to include this term in this

123:33

equation again so now you need armed you

123:37

knew minus 1/2 G mu nu R which is this

123:43

just system here and now you need to

123:46

include the fact that you could have had

123:48

a metric tensor term in here so we'll

123:51

add it and we will have a constant which

123:55

we'll call capital lambda multiplied by

124:01

the metric tensor and that equals 8 pi G

124:06

T mu nu divided by C to the fourth this

124:12

part you'll remember was the Einstein

124:15

tensor G mu nu what is this capital

124:20

lambda term where it's called the

124:22

cosmological constant and curiously it

124:25

is the constant which Einstein first

124:28

thought of way back when he was trying

124:31

to identify how you could describe space

124:35

in mathematical terms now he was being

124:37

told at the time that space was fixed

124:40

and unchanging but nothing moved in

124:43

space if he looked at it over a huge

124:45

cosmological time and space frame

124:48

obviously the earth goes around the Sun

124:50

but generally speaking everything stays

124:53

as it is that's what people thought an

124:55

Einstein said well that can't be right

124:57

because gravity would tend to make all

124:59

the galaxies pull together and if I'm

125:02

being told that they are not pulling

125:04

together

125:05

there must be something which is

125:07

balancing gravity and pushing the

125:10

galaxies apart so that gravitational

125:12

attraction is being balanced by the

125:16

thing that's pushing them apart and he

125:18

found that you could reintroduce that

125:20

into his Einstein field equations as the

125:23

constant that you multiplied by the

125:25

metric tensor this term is a very very

125:29

small term and you will often find it

125:31

will be left out of the Einstein field

125:33

patience it only becomes relevant when

125:36

you're talking about major cosmological

125:39

scales and that's it

125:42

we have derived in sorts the Einstein

125:46

field equations just to remind you mu

125:49

and nu are of course the time and space

125:52

dimensions naught one two and three and

125:54

therefore there are sixteen equations

125:56

there but six of them are identical to

126:00

another six so it reduces to just ten if

126:02

you want more information I remind you

126:04

that Leonard Susskind professor Leonard

126:07

Susskind of Stanford University gave an

126:09

excellent series in 2008 and I gave you

126:12

the link to that at the beginning of

126:14

this video that's it we're done the

126:18

Einstein field equations for beginners

00:00:00,000 --> hello today I'm going to try to derive00:02:00,000
00:02:00,000 --> the Einstein field equations this will00:00:06,000
00:00:06,000 --> be a basic introduction it won't be 00:00:08,000
00:00:08,000 --> rigorous it will cover the essence but 00:00:11,000
00:00:11,000 --> it will still be quite complex if you 00:00:14,000
00:00:14,000 --> want more detail then I refer you to 00:00:16,000
00:00:16,000 --> Professor Leonard Susskind excellent 00:00:18,000
00:00:18,000 --> lectures that he gave from October to 00:00:20,000
00:00:20,000 --> December 2008 at Stanford I've put a 00:00:24,000
00:00:24,000 --> link to the YouTube version of these 00:00:26,000
00:00:26,000 --> lectures in an annotation on this video 00:00:29,000
00:00:29,000 --> I am going to follow his approach so 00:00:32,000
00:00:32,000 --> that it will be familiar to you but I 00:00:34,000
00:00:34,000 --> shall do it in a much more simplified 00:00:36,000
00:00:36,000 --> version and let's always remember that 00:00:39,000
00:00:39,000 --> it took Einstein ten years to develop 00:00:42,000
00:00:42,000 --> these equations and he had access to 00:00:45,000
00:00:45,000 --> many maths professors on the way as 00:00:49,000
00:00:49,000 --> usual I'm making the assumption that you 00:00:51,000
00:00:51,000 --> understand calculus and basic geometry 00:00:54,000
00:00:54,000 --> and that you've also seen or are aware 00:00:56,000
00:00:56,000 --> of the information in my general 00:00:58,000
00:00:58,000 --> relativity videos that are already up on 00:01:01,000
00:01:01,000 --> YouTube and in particular that you are 00:01:04,000
00:01:04,000 --> aware of two key points the first is 00:01:07,000
00:01:07,000 --> what is called the principle of 00:01:09,000
00:01:09,000 --> equivalence and what that says is that 00:01:12,000
00:01:12,000 --> if you are in a box with no windows then 00:01:16,000
00:01:16,000 --> you can't tell the difference between 00:01:18,000
00:01:18,000 --> being in outer space and accelerating 00:01:22,000
00:01:22,000 --> with an acceleration G or being in the 00:01:26,000
00:01:26,000 --> same box on the surface of the earth 00:01:29,000
00:01:29,000 --> stationary but subject to the 00:01:32,000
00:01:32,000 --> gravitational force which carries an 00:01:34,000
00:01:34,000 --> acceleration G there is no experiment 00:01:37,000
00:01:37,000 --> let's put you in the box 00:01:39,000
00:01:39,000 --> there is no experiment that you can do 00:01:41,000
00:01:41,000 --> that will distinguish between those two 00:01:44,000
00:01:44,000 --> situations now that is actually not 00:01:47,000
00:01:47,000 --> quite true the difference of course is 00:01:50,000
00:01:50,000 --> that if you are in outer space traveling 00:01:52,000
00:01:52,000 --> with an acceleration G then all parts of 00:01:56,000
00:01:56,000 --> this box including you are accelerating 00:01:59,000
00:01:59,000 --> at the acceleration G if you are on 00:02:03,000
00:02:03,000 --> earth then because the value of G varies 00:02:08,000
00:02:08,000 --> according to the height above the earth 00:02:10,000
00:02:10,000 --> the value of G at this 00:02:13,000
00:02:13,000 --> point will be ever so slightly greater 00:02:16,000
00:02:16,000 --> than the value of G at this point and so 00:02:20,000
00:02:20,000 --> there is a slight difference in the 00:02:22,000
00:02:22,000 --> value of G in this situation and if you 00:02:25,000
00:02:25,000 --> can measure that then you can tell the 00:02:27,000
00:02:27,000 --> difference that difference is called the 00:02:29,000
00:02:29,000 --> tidal force but apart from that Einstein 00:02:33,000
00:02:33,000 --> said that that was a principle of 00:02:35,000
00:02:35,000 --> equivalence you can't tell the 00:02:37,000
00:02:37,000 --> difference whether you are accelerating 00:02:39,000
00:02:39,000 --> at GE or subject to a gravitational 00:02:42,000
00:02:42,000 --> force which is represented by the 00:02:44,000
00:02:44,000 --> acceleration G the second principle is 00:02:48,000
00:02:48,000 --> that light bends in a gravitational 00:02:51,000
00:02:51,000 --> field this was Einstein's reasoning if 00:02:54,000
00:02:54,000 --> you take the person who is in the box 00:02:57,000
00:02:57,000 --> that is accelerating through space with 00:03:00,000
00:03:00,000 --> an acceleration G and here is the box 00:03:04,000
00:03:04,000 --> and this time we're going to shine a 00:03:08,000
00:03:08,000 --> light from this side of the box to the 00:03:11,000
00:03:11,000 --> other side of the box but of course that 00:03:14,000
00:03:14,000 --> will take a finite time albeit small and 00:03:17,000
00:03:17,000 --> if this box is accelerating with an 00:03:20,000
00:03:20,000 --> acceleration G by the time the light 00:03:23,000
00:03:23,000 --> gets halfway across the box will have 00:03:26,000
00:03:26,000 --> accelerated a little bit further forward 00:03:29,000
00:03:29,000 --> so it will now be here which means the 00:03:32,000
00:03:32,000 --> light will have reached that position 00:03:34,000
00:03:34,000 --> there by the time the light gets to the 00:03:37,000
00:03:37,000 --> right hand side the box will of course 00:03:39,000
00:03:39,000 --> have accelerated still further and now 00:03:45,000
00:03:45,000 --> the light which of course is just going 00:03:47,000
00:03:47,000 --> in a straight line will reach here so if 00:03:51,000
00:03:51,000 --> you look at it it appears within the box 00:03:54,000
00:03:54,000 --> that the light has gone from here to a 00:03:57,000
00:03:57,000 --> point lower down to a point even lower 00:03:59,000
00:03:59,000 --> down in other words the overall 00:04:01,000
00:04:01,000 --> impression is that the light has gone 00:04:04,000
00:04:04,000 --> from here to here to here and that's a 00:04:07,000
00:04:07,000 --> curve at least it should be if I've 00:04:09,000
00:04:09,000 --> drawn it properly so Einstein says if 00:04:13,000
00:04:13,000 --> that is what happens when you are 00:04:15,000
00:04:15,000 --> accelerating through space with 00:04:18,000
00:04:18,000 --> acceleration G since the principal the 00:04:21,000
00:04:21,000 --> equivalent says you 00:04:22,000
00:04:22,000 --> can't tell the difference between that 00:04:24,000
00:04:24,000 --> and being stationary on earth subject to 00:04:28,000
00:04:28,000 --> an acceleration G then the same thing 00:04:31,000
00:04:31,000 --> should happen in this scenario here that 00:04:34,000
00:04:34,000 --> light will appear to bend in a 00:04:36,000
00:04:36,000 --> gravitational field now of course he 00:04:39,000
00:04:39,000 --> could have been wrong but in fact this 00:04:42,000
00:04:42,000 --> was shown to be true during a solar 00:04:45,000
00:04:45,000 --> eclipse what happens during a solar 00:04:48,000
00:04:48,000 --> eclipse is that the moon essentially 00:04:50,000
00:04:50,000 --> blocks the Sun said that from the earth 00:04:53,000
00:04:53,000 --> the Sun as it were is blotted out and 00:04:57,000
00:04:57,000 --> what was noted from the position on 00:05:00,000
00:05:00,000 --> earth was that they could see a star 00:05:04,000
00:05:04,000 --> just slightly to the right of the Sun 00:05:08,000
00:05:08,000 --> but they knew astronomers knew that that 00:05:11,000
00:05:11,000 --> star actually was located behind the Sun 00:05:15,000
00:05:15,000 --> and it shouldn't have been possible to 00:05:17,000
00:05:17,000 --> see it and the explanation was that what 00:05:20,000
00:05:20,000 --> was actually happening was that light 00:05:22,000
00:05:22,000 --> from That star was being bent in the 00:05:25,000
00:05:25,000 --> gravitational field of the Sun and then 00:05:30,000
00:05:30,000 --> coming to us on earth giving the 00:05:32,000
00:05:32,000 --> impression that the star was here when 00:05:35,000
00:05:35,000 --> in fact the star was really here but the 00:05:38,000
00:05:38,000 --> light was being bent in the Sun's 00:05:40,000
00:05:40,000 --> gravitational field now here was the 00:05:43,000
00:05:43,000 --> problem for Einstein Newton's law of 00:05:46,000
00:05:46,000 --> gravitation which everybody had thought 00:05:48,000
00:05:48,000 --> had served as well for so long 00:05:50,000
00:05:50,000 --> says that the gravitational force is 00:05:53,000
00:05:53,000 --> equal to the gravitational constant 00:05:55,000
00:05:55,000 --> times the mass of one body multiplied by 00:05:59,000
00:05:59,000 --> the mass of another body divided by the 00:06:02,000
00:06:02,000 --> distance between them R squared or 00:06:05,000
00:06:05,000 --> divided by the distance squared and 00:06:08,000
00:06:08,000 --> that's fine 00:06:10,000
00:06:10,000 --> except that in this situation here light 00:06:13,000
00:06:13,000 --> is bending in a gravitational field but 00:06:16,000
00:06:16,000 --> photons of light have no mass so these 00:06:20,000
00:06:20,000 --> two mass terms were at least the Sun has 00:06:23,000
00:06:23,000 --> an S but the photon doesn't so this form 00:06:27,000
00:06:27,000 --> of Newton's law doesn't work if it is 00:06:30,000
00:06:30,000 --> going to apply to light five photons 光量子00:06:33,000
00:06:33,000 --> have 00:06:34,000
00:06:34,000 --> no maths so Einstein came up with a 00:06:37,000
00:06:37,000 --> completely different approach to gravity 00:06:40,000
00:06:40,000 --> instead of there being gravity he said 00:06:42,000
00:06:42,000 --> actually what is happening is that all 00:06:45,000
00:06:45,000 --> forms of motion are represented by 00:06:48,000
00:06:48,000 --> movement in curved space-time and I can 00:06:53,000
00:06:53,000 --> illustrate that in this way let's 00:06:55,000
00:06:55,000 --> suppose that we take a trampoline蹦床 this 00:06:58,000
00:06:58,000 --> is the surface of the trampoline and 00:07:01,000
00:07:01,000 --> that's representing space-time and we 00:07:05,000
00:07:05,000 --> put a small nut marble on that 00:07:07,000
00:07:07,000 --> trampoline the marble will have 00:07:09,000
00:07:09,000 --> virtually no effect it might make a very 00:07:12,000
00:07:12,000 --> tiny indentation on the trampoline but 00:07:15,000
00:07:15,000 --> now let's suppose I get on the 00:07:18,000
00:07:18,000 --> trampoline if I get on the trampoline 00:07:21,000
00:07:21,000 --> with my weight the trampoline is going 00:07:24,000
00:07:24,000 --> to bend quite substantially and that is 00:07:29,000
00:07:29,000 --> the equivalent of bent space-time or 00:07:32,000
00:07:32,000 --> curved space-time what's going to happen 00:07:34,000
00:07:34,000 --> to this marble 弹子大理石00:07:35,000
00:07:35,000 --> well the marble is now going to fall 00:07:39,000
00:07:39,000 --> towards me the analogy类推 is not brilliant 00:07:43,000
00:07:43,000 --> but it'll do for our purposes now Newton 00:07:47,000
00:07:47,000 --> said that that movement towards me was 00:07:50,000
00:07:50,000 --> caused by gravitational attraction引力 00:07:53,000
00:07:53,000 --> Einstein on the other hand says no what 00:07:56,000
00:07:56,000 --> is happening is the marble is moving 00:07:59,000
00:07:59,000 --> along the shortest path in curved 00:08:02,000
00:08:02,000 --> space-time so that when the earth goes 00:08:06,000
00:08:06,000 --> around the Sun there's the Sun and 00:08:09,000
00:08:09,000 --> here's the earth in a reasonable 00:08:13,000
00:08:13,000 --> circular orbit going around the Sun 00:08:15,000
00:08:15,000 --> Newton says that there's a gravitational 00:08:19,000
00:08:19,000 --> force between the Sun and the earth 00:08:21,000
00:08:21,000 --> which provides the centripetal force 00:08:24,000
00:08:24,000 --> that keeps the earth in orbit Einstein 00:08:28,000
00:08:28,000 --> says no that's not it at all 00:08:30,000
00:08:30,000 --> what happens is the Sun being massive 00:08:32,000
00:08:32,000 --> curves space-time and the earth is 00:08:35,000
00:08:35,000 --> simply going round that curve in a 00:08:38,000
00:08:38,000 --> straight line in curved space-time now 00:08:42,000
00:08:42,000 --> you might be wondering two things 00:08:44,000
00:08:44,000 --> firstly what is space-time 00:08:46,000
00:08:46,000 --> secondly why did Einstein think that it 00:08:48,000
00:08:48,000 --> would be curved 00:08:49,000
00:08:49,000 --> well space-time is really just space and 00:08:53,000
00:08:53,000 --> time all thought of as one set of 00:08:56,000
00:08:56,000 --> coordinates we usually think of space as 00:08:59,000
00:08:59,000 --> having three dimensions which we 00:09:01,000
00:09:01,000 --> represent by three what are called 00:09:03,000
00:09:03,000 --> orthogonal axes they are at right angles 00:09:07,000
00:09:07,000 --> to one another so we normally have the x 00:09:09,000
00:09:09,000 --> axis the y axis and the z axis or if you 00:09:13,000
00:09:13,000 --> like we have three dimensions in space 00:09:15,000
00:09:15,000 --> up and down back and forth and side to 00:09:18,000
00:09:18,000 --> side if you add a time dimension to that 00:09:22,000
00:09:22,000 --> you get four-dimensional space-time 00:09:25,000
00:09:25,000 --> problem with four-dimensional spacetime 00:09:27,000
00:09:27,000 --> is it's very difficult to draw because 00:09:30,000
00:09:30,000 --> we can only conceive three dimensions so 00:09:34,000
00:09:34,000 --> I'm going to cheat and I'm going to draw 00:09:35,000
00:09:35,000 --> one dimension of time and one dimension 00:09:39,000
00:09:39,000 --> of space which is the x axis I could've 00:09:43,000
00:09:43,000 --> caused or another dimension this way but 00:09:46,000
00:09:46,000 --> I'll just leave it as one dimension of 00:09:48,000
00:09:48,000 --> time and one dimension of space now if 00:09:51,000
00:09:51,000 --> you draw a constant velocity in 00:09:54,000
00:09:54,000 --> space-time you get a straight line 00:09:57,000
00:09:57,000 --> because a straight line is distance 00:10:00,000
00:10:00,000 --> divided by time it's a constant distance 00:10:02,000
00:10:02,000 --> divided by a constant time and that is a 00:10:05,000
00:10:05,000 --> constant velocity but if you accelerate 00:10:09,000
00:10:09,000 --> in space-time you get a curve the reason 00:10:13,000
00:10:13,000 --> of course being that acceleration means 00:10:15,000
00:10:15,000 --> that the longer the time the further you 00:10:20,000
00:10:20,000 --> go so there is a curve in the 00:10:24,000
00:10:24,000 --> acceleration and because gravity causes 00:10:27,000
00:10:27,000 --> acceleration it causes a graph which is 00:10:31,000
00:10:31,000 --> curved in these space-time coordinates 00:10:34,000
00:10:34,000 --> and Einstein's view was that therefore 00:10:38,000
00:10:38,000 --> in some way space-time must be curved if 00:10:42,000
00:10:42,000 --> it is creating an acceleration which has 00:10:45,000
00:10:45,000 --> the effect of creating a curve in those 00:10:48,000
00:10:48,000 --> space-time coordinates well that's the 00:10:52,000
00:10:52,000 --> end of the introduction so now it's time 00:10:54,000
00:10:54,000 --> to introduce you to the einstein field 00:10:56,000
00:10:56,000 --> equations that 00:10:57,000
00:10:57,000 --> we're killing to try to derive and there 00:11:00,000
00:11:00,000 --> they are you may observe that there is 00:11:04,000
00:11:04,000 --> only one equation but in fact that's not 00:11:06,000
00:11:06,000 --> true because you will notice that there 00:11:09,000
00:11:09,000 --> are some indices下标们 mu and nu which arrive   00:11:12,000
00:11:12,000 --> arise in several places in the equations 00:11:16,000
00:11:16,000 --> now mu and nu represent the dimensions 00:11:19,000
00:11:19,000 --> of space-time not one two and three 00:11:23,000
00:11:23,000 --> naught is time one is the x axis two is 00:11:28,000
00:11:28,000 --> the y axis and z is the sorry three is 00:11:32,000
00:11:32,000 --> the z axis so mu and nu can each take 00:11:35,000
00:11:35,000 --> four values between naught and 3 and the 00:11:39,000
00:11:39,000 --> combination of mu and nu means that 00:11:41,000
00:11:41,000 -->  there are 16 variations of this equation 00:11:46,000
00:11:46,000 --> with mu and nu having numbers between 00:11:48,000
00:11:48,000 --> naught and 3 you might therefore think 00:11:52,000
00:11:52,000 --> that there are 16 equations in 00:11:55,000
00:11:55,000 --> four-dimensional space-time but in fact 00:11:57,000
00:11:57,000 --> 6 of them are duplicates so in fact it 00:12:00,000
00:12:00,000 --> reduces to 10 so you are looking at 10 00:12:03,000
00:12:03,000 --> Einstein field equations now what all 00:12:08,000
00:12:08,000 --> these hieroglyphics mean will you'll be 00:12:10,000
00:12:10,000 --> pleased to know that some of them you 00:12:11,000
00:12:11,000 --> already know you will know what 1/2 is 00:12:14,000
00:12:14,000 --> you know what 8 is you know what PI is G 00:12:18,000
00:12:18,000 --> is the good old fashioned gravitational 00:12:20,000
00:12:20,000 --> constant and C is the speed of light so 00:12:25,000
00:12:25,000 --> there are only a few things that we need 00:12:26,000
00:12:26,000 --> to sort out first we've got this 00:12:29,000
00:12:29,000 --> peculiar奇异的 term R mu nu which is called 00:12:33,000
00:12:33,000 --> the  will derive 00:12:36,000
00:12:36,000 --> that they need two places we've got this 00:12:39,000
00:12:39,000 --> term G mu nu G mu nu is the metric tensor00:12:43,000
00:12:43,000 -->  will derive that then we have R 00:12:47,000
00:12:47,000 --> but with no indices that's called the 00:12:51,000
00:12:51,000 -->  and we'll show what 00:12:53,000
00:12:53,000 --> that is then we've got capital lambda 00:12:57,000
00:12:57,000 --> which turns out to be the  00:13:00,000
00:13:00,000 --> and we'll explain the reason 00:13:02,000
00:13:02,000 --> for that and finally we've got T mu nu 00:13:05,000
00:13:05,000 --> which is the 00:13:09,000
00:13:09,000 --> stress energy momentum tensor 00:13:10,000
00:13:10,000 --> and we'll try to explain what that is 00:13:13,000
00:13:13,000 --> now the whole point about this equation 00:13:15,000
00:13:15,000 --> is that it balances two things 00:13:18,000
00:13:18,000 --> everything on the left-hand side refers 00:13:22,000
00:13:22,000 --> to curvature of space-time everything on 00:13:26,000
00:13:26,000 --> the right-hand side is to do with 00:13:28,000
00:13:28,000 --> mass and energy and as some people have some 00:13:32,000
00:13:32,000 --> sometimes helpfully said that what 00:13:34,000
00:13:34,000 --> Einstein field equations basically say 00:13:37,000
00:13:37,000 --> is that mass tells space-time how to 00:13:41,000
00:13:41,000 --> curve and curved space-time tells más 00:13:45,000
00:13:45,000 --> how to move so here's our agenda议程 for the 00:13:50,000
00:13:50,000 --> remainder of this video we've done the 00:13:52,000
00:13:52,000 --> introduction next we shall do metric 00:13:55,000
00:13:55,000 --> tensors then we'll move on to 00:13:57,000
00:13:57,000 --> Christoffel symbols which are capital 00:14:00,000
00:14:00,000 --> gamma terms you may wonder why I need to 00:14:03,000
00:14:03,000 --> do that because they don't appear to 00:14:05,000
00:14:05,000 --> feature in the Einstein field equation 00:14:08,000
00:14:08,000 --> but they are heavily involved in the 00:14:11,000
00:14:11,000 --> Ricci curvature tensor so we'll need the 00:14:14,000
00:14:14,000 --> Christoffel symbol then we'll look at 00:14:17,000
00:14:17,000 --> curvature itself which will enable us to 00:14:20,000
00:14:20,000 --> derive the Ricci curvature tensor and 00:14:23,000
00:14:23,000 --> the curvature scalar then we'll look at 00:14:25,000
00:14:25,000 --> the stress energy momentum tensor and 00:14:28,000
00:14:28,000 --> then the cosmological constant and 00:14:32,000
00:14:32,000 --> finally we'll put it all together you 00:14:35,000
00:14:35,000 --> may want to take a break through this 00:14:37,000
00:14:37,000 --> video just to collect your thoughts 00:14:39,000
00:14:39,000 --> indeed before we move on to the next 00:14:42,000
00:14:42,000 --> section you might fancy a break now okay 00:14:46,000
00:14:46,000 --> part two the metric tensor we're going 00:14:50,000
00:14:50,000 --> to consider a field we could consider 00:14:52,000
00:14:52,000 --> any field a magnetic field an electric 00:14:55,000
00:14:55,000 --> field a temperature field I'm going to 00:14:57,000
00:14:57,000 --> consider one of the most basic fields of 00:14:59,000
00:14:59,000 --> all a field with grass where the cows graze00:15:02,000
00:15:02,000 -->  here is my field and it's going to 00:15:07,000
00:15:07,000 --> be a very bumpy颠簸 field there are hills 00:15:09,000
00:15:09,000 --> all over my field and here my standing 00:15:14,000
00:15:14,000 --> on one of the hills and the value of the 00:15:18,000
00:15:18,000 --> field is going to be for the height 00:15:21,000
00:15:21,000 --> above sea level so we usually give 00:15:25,000
00:15:25,000 --> the value Phi and everywhere you'll 00:15:28,000
00:15:28,000 --> agree in my field there will be a height 00:15:32,000
00:15:32,000 --> above sea level that I can measure and 00:15:34,000
00:15:34,000 --> that height will constantly change 00:15:36,000
00:15:36,000 --> because my field is a very bumpy field 00:15:40,000
00:15:40,000 --> now how do I know where I am 00:15:43,000
00:15:43,000 --> well I can impose a set of coordinates 00:15:47,000
00:15:47,000 --> here's my x co-ordinate here's my 00:15:50,000
00:15:50,000 --> y-coordinate and I am then at that 00:15:53,000
00:15:53,000 --> position that position on the x 00:15:56,000
00:15:56,000 --> coordinate and that position on the y 00:15:58,000
00:15:58,000 --> coordinate it's a bit like a map 00:16:00,000
00:16:00,000 --> reference so I uniquely define my 00:16:04,000
00:16:04,000 --> position and for every position I take I 00:16:07,000
00:16:07,000 --> can find a value of Phi which is 00:16:10,000
00:16:10,000 --> essentially the height above sea level 00:16:11,000
00:16:11,000 --> of my position in the field the question 00:16:16,000
00:16:16,000 --> I now want to ask is how does that 00:16:20,000
00:16:20,000 --> height change if I move a little bit and 00:16:24,000
00:16:24,000 --> you should immediately respond that it 00:16:27,000
00:16:27,000 --> depends on which direction I move the 00:16:31,000
00:16:31,000 --> reason for that is let's suppose that 00:16:33,000
00:16:33,000 --> part of the field consists of a reach 00:16:36,000
00:16:36,000 --> now a ridges something where the slope 00:16:41,000
00:16:41,000 --> goes down on one side and down on the 00:16:45,000
00:16:45,000 --> other side but along the top it's flat 00:16:50,000
00:16:50,000 --> so if I'm standing on the top of the 00:16:54,000
00:16:54,000 --> ridge and I move let's say this is the X 00:16:57,000
00:16:57,000 --> direction if I move in the X direction I 00:17:00,000
00:17:00,000 --> go down the ridge quite substantially 00:17:02,000
00:17:02,000 --> but if I go in the Y direction let's say 00:17:05,000
00:17:05,000 --> that's the Y direction I'm just walking 00:17:08,000
00:17:08,000 --> along the top of the ridge and that's 00:17:10,000
00:17:10,000 --> flat so direction of movement is 00:17:13,000
00:17:13,000 --> important in the X direction I would 00:17:16,000
00:17:16,000 --> drop considerably in the Y direction I 00:17:18,000
00:17:18,000 --> stay on level ground now how can I tell 00:17:23,000
00:17:23,000 --> by how much the height will vary as I 00:17:26,000
00:17:26,000 --> move along well let's consider a 00:17:29,000
00:17:29,000 --> gradient here is a gradient which I'm 00:17:33,000
00:17:33,000 --> going to call a one-in-ten gradient what 00:17:38,000
00:17:38,000 --> that means 00:17:39,000
00:17:39,000 --> is that for every 10 meters that I walk 00:17:41,000
00:17:41,000 --> along I will drop 1 meter so if I start 00:17:46,000
00:17:46,000 --> here and I walk 10 meters by the time I 00:17:49,000
00:17:49,000 --> get to the end I have not only walked 10 00:17:52,000
00:17:52,000 --> meters along 00:17:53,000
00:17:53,000 --> I have dropped 1 meter down and the way 00:17:57,000
00:17:57,000 --> you would describe that mathematically 00:17:58,000
00:17:58,000 --> is you would say that the change in 00:18:00,000
00:18:00,000 --> height as I walk along is equal to the 00:18:04,000
00:18:04,000 --> gradient which we express as defy by the 00:18:07,000
00:18:07,000 --> X the rate of change of height with 00:18:09,000
00:18:09,000 --> distance that's what 1 in 10 is the rate 00:18:12,000
00:18:12,000 --> of change in five the distance 00:18:13,000
00:18:13,000 --> multiplied by the distance you actually 00:18:16,000
00:18:16,000 --> walk DX let's just try that for a moment 00:18:20,000
00:18:20,000 --> the change in height will equal the 00:18:23,000
00:18:23,000 --> gradient well I told you what the 00:18:25,000
00:18:25,000 --> gradient梯度 is it's 1 in 10 and let's say I 00:18:28,000
00:18:28,000 --> walk 5 meters so that the distance DX is 00:18:32,000
00:18:32,000 --> 5 meters that means that D Phi will 00:18:36,000
00:18:36,000 --> equal 5 over 10 which of course is a 00:18:38,000
00:18:38,000 --> half a meter so what we've just 00:18:40,000
00:18:40,000 --> calculated is that if you walk 5 meters 00:18:43,000
00:18:43,000 --> along a one-in-ten gradient your height 00:18:46,000
00:18:46,000 --> changes by half a meter but this is the 00:18:50,000
00:18:50,000 --> general form you change in height or 00:18:53,000
00:18:53,000 --> change in the value of field is equal to 00:18:55,000
00:18:55,000 --> the gradient multiplied by the distance 00:18:58,000
00:18:58,000 --> you travel now clearly in my field I'm 00:19:02,000
00:19:02,000 --> not going to have clear gradients like 00:19:04,000
00:19:04,000 --> this because it's a very bumpy and 00:19:06,000
00:19:06,000 --> irregular field but over a very very 00:19:09,000
00:19:09,000 --> small distance which is why I've put DX 00:19:12,000
00:19:12,000 --> and Dfine 00:19:13,000
00:19:13,000 --> that will be true but as I said 00:19:17,000
00:19:17,000 --> direction matters so consequently one 00:19:21,000
00:19:21,000 --> would have to say that the change of 00:19:22,000
00:19:22,000 --> height if you are traveling in the X 00:19:25,000
00:19:25,000 --> Direction is equal to the gradient in 00:19:29,000
00:19:29,000 --> the X Direction multiplied the distance 00:19:33,000
00:19:33,000 --> multiplied by the distance you walk in 00:19:35,000
00:19:35,000 --> the X direction or you can also say that 00:19:39,000
00:19:39,000 --> the change in height in the Y Direction 00:19:42,000
00:19:42,000 --> is equal to the gradient in the Y 00:19:45,000
00:19:45,000 --> Direction multiplied by the distance you 00:19:48,000
00:19:48,000 --> walk in the Y direction which is fine 00:19:51,000
00:19:51,000 --> and these two gray 00:19:52,000
00:19:52,000 --> ian's will not of course be the same if 00:19:55,000
00:19:55,000 --> we were on the ridge this would be a 00:19:57,000
00:19:57,000 --> very steep gradient in the X direction 00:19:59,000
00:19:59,000 --> but there would be a level gradient in 00:20:01,000
00:20:01,000 --> the Y direction of course I may not want 00:20:05,000
00:20:05,000 --> to walk in just the X or the y direction 00:20:08,000
00:20:08,000 --> let's suppose that instead of walking in 00:20:12,000
00:20:12,000 --> X or Y direction I want to simply walk 00:20:16,000
00:20:16,000 --> in that direction just to be awkward 00:20:19,000
00:20:19,000 --> well of course that is that is simply a 00:20:24,000
00:20:24,000 --> combination of walking in the Y 00:20:27,000
00:20:27,000 --> direction and walking in the X direction 00:20:32,000
00:20:32,000 --> and in fact we can regard these as 00:20:36,000
00:20:36,000 --> vectors and in my video on the 00:20:40,000
00:20:40,000 --> manipulation of vectors I showed that 00:20:42,000
00:20:42,000 --> when you want to add vectors together 00:20:45,000
00:20:45,000 --> you do it by a tip-to-tail process so 00:20:48,000
00:20:48,000 --> that in fact you take these two vectors 00:20:50,000
00:20:50,000 --> dy and DX and you put them tip-to-tail 00:20:53,000
00:20:53,000 --> it doesn't matter which way you do it so 00:20:55,000
00:20:55,000 --> let's take DX it's like that then dy 00:20:58,000
00:20:58,000 --> goes the tip of the X vector matches the 00:21:02,000
00:21:02,000 --> tail of the Y vector so this is the X 00:21:04,000
00:21:04,000 --> this is dy and then the resultant is the 00:21:08,000
00:21:08,000 --> tail of the first and the tip of the 00:21:11,000
00:21:11,000 --> last so that becomes the resultant 00:21:14,000
00:21:14,000 --> vector which we call d s and we can use 00:21:18,000
00:21:18,000 --> pythagoras to work out what d s is of 00:21:20,000
00:21:20,000 --> course the s squared is equal to DX 00:21:23,000
00:21:23,000 --> squared plus dy squared that of course 00:21:27,000
00:21:27,000 --> is very simple if you want to add the 00:21:31,000
00:21:31,000 --> vectors together that gives you this is 00:21:33,000
00:21:33,000 --> the magnitude but for purposes of adding 00:21:36,000
00:21:36,000 --> the vectors together we simply say that 00:21:38,000
00:21:38,000 --> D s and we put a line above it to 00:21:41,000
00:21:41,000 --> indicate that it's a vector is equal to 00:21:43,000
00:21:43,000 --> DX + D Y or if we want to know what the 00:21:49,000
00:21:49,000 --> change in height is we can say that the 00:21:53,000
00:21:53,000 --> change in height as we go along the path 00:21:56,000
00:21:56,000 --> s is equal to the change in height as we 00:21:59,000
00:21:59,000 --> go along the path X plus the change in 00:22:03,000
00:22:03,000 --> height as we go along the path 00:22:05,000
00:22:05,000 --> why but these two terms here D X D Phi X 00:22:11,000
00:22:11,000 --> and D Phi Y we calculated up here that's 00:22:16,000
00:22:16,000 --> what these two terms say so I'm going to 00:22:18,000
00:22:18,000 --> substitute these values into this 00:22:23,000
00:22:23,000 --> formula here and that will give me that 00:22:26,000
00:22:26,000 --> D Phi s is equal to now for D Phi X I'm 00:22:30,000
00:22:30,000 --> going to replace that by the gradient 00:22:33,000
00:22:33,000 --> times the distance and here I'm going to 00:22:37,000
00:22:37,000 --> replace this by the gradient but this 00:22:39,000
00:22:39,000 --> time in the Y Direction times the 00:22:41,000
00:22:41,000 --> distance in the Y direction and to be 00:22:46,000
00:22:46,000 --> absolutely proper about all of this what 00:22:49,000
00:22:49,000 --> I should actually write here is I'm 00:22:52,000
00:22:52,000 --> going to give these gradient terms curly 00:22:55,000
00:22:55,000 --> DS and the reason I'm going to do that 00:23:00,000
00:23:00,000 --> is because that's what's called a 00:23:02,000
00:23:02,000 --> partial derivative it simply indicates 00:23:06,000
00:23:06,000 --> that although this is the derivative 00:23:08,000
00:23:08,000 --> with respect to X there are other 00:23:11,000
00:23:11,000 --> derivatives in this case a derivative in 00:23:13,000
00:23:13,000 --> respect to Y it's not the only 00:23:16,000
00:23:16,000 --> derivative so it's called a partial 00:23:17,000
00:23:17,000 --> derivative and it's indicated as a 00:23:20,000
00:23:20,000 --> partial derivative derivative by virtue 00:23:22,000
00:23:22,000 --> of having a curly D now I want to pause 00:23:26,000
00:23:26,000 --> for a while while I do a in the 00:23:28,000
00:23:28,000 --> miniature change and I promise you it 00:23:31,000
00:23:31,000 --> won't hurt up to now I have been using 00:23:34,000
00:23:34,000 --> the coordinates x and y I am now going 00:23:39,000
00:23:39,000 --> to change them wherever I have used X 00:23:42,000
00:23:42,000 --> before I'm going to call that x1 and 00:23:46,000
00:23:46,000 --> wherever I have used Y before I'm going 00:23:49,000
00:23:49,000 --> to call that X 2 why do I do that well 00:23:54,000
00:23:54,000 --> for three dimensions in space we 00:23:57,000
00:23:57,000 --> typically use XY and Z as our 00:24:01,000
00:24:01,000 --> coordinates suppose I needed another 00:24:04,000
00:24:04,000 --> coordinate what letter am I going to use 00:24:07,000
00:24:07,000 --> there isn't one after Zed I could of 00:24:09,000
00:24:09,000 --> course find another spare letter but 00:24:11,000
00:24:11,000 --> letters of the alphabet alphabet tend to 00:24:13,000
00:24:13,000 --> be used for different purposes in 00:24:15,000
00:24:15,000 --> physics and it you become very confusing 00:24:17,000
00:24:17,000 --> whereas if I relay 00:24:19,000
00:24:19,000 --> bullies x1 x2 and x3 if I need another 00:24:26,000
00:24:26,000 --> coordinate it's a piece of cake 00:24:28,000
00:24:28,000 --> it's x4 indeed I can even have an X 00:24:32,000
00:24:32,000 --> naught which I will actually use for a 00:24:36,000
00:24:36,000 --> time coordinate but find these further 00:24:39,000
00:24:39,000 --> dimensions of space I can have X 4 X 5 X 00:24:42,000
00:24:42,000 --> 6 and so on there's no limit so firstly 00:24:46,000
00:24:46,000 --> changing the coordinates into this 00:24:49,000
00:24:49,000 --> system means I've got an unlimited 00:24:50,000
00:24:50,000 --> number of coordinates if I need them or 00:24:54,000
00:24:54,000 --> dimensions of space and secondly it 00:24:58,000
00:24:58,000 --> releases the Y system which I'm going to 00:25:01,000
00:25:01,000 --> use for a different purpose a bit later 00:25:03,000
00:25:03,000 --> on so now I'm going to rewrite this 00:25:06,000
00:25:06,000 --> equation here in my new coordinates 00:25:10,000
00:25:10,000 --> simply replacing X by X 1 and Y by X 2 00:25:15,000
00:25:15,000 --> they're exactly the same I've just 00:25:17,000
00:25:17,000 --> called them by different names so if I 00:25:20,000
00:25:20,000 --> do that I will get that D Phi which is 00:25:24,000
00:25:24,000 --> the overall change in height as far as 00:25:26,000
00:25:26,000 --> my field is concerned it's going to be 00:25:29,000
00:25:29,000 --> equal to the gradient which is defined 00:25:32,000
00:25:32,000 --> by the X and now that's the x1 times the 00:25:35,000
00:25:35,000 --> distance I move DX 1 plus the gradient 00:25:39,000
00:25:39,000 --> in the Y direction which is now the DX 2 00:25:42,000
00:25:42,000 --> Direction times the distance I move in 00:25:46,000
00:25:46,000 --> the X 2 direction and of course I could 00:25:49,000
00:25:49,000 --> add further terms X 3 X 4 X 5 as many as 00:25:53,000
00:25:53,000 --> I need I'm only going to work in two 00:25:54,000
00:25:54,000 --> dimensions to keep it simple and I think 00:25:58,000
00:25:58,000 --> you'll see that this equation here can 00:26:01,000
00:26:01,000 --> be simplified by saying that D Phi is 00:26:03,000
00:26:03,000 --> equal to the sum over N of the gradient 00:26:10,000
00:26:10,000 --> divided by the n sorry divided by the X 00:26:13,000
00:26:13,000 --> n multiplied by the X n when n is 1 you 00:26:21,000
00:26:21,000 --> get that term there when n is 2 you get 00:26:25,000
00:26:25,000 --> this term here and the sum term means 00:26:28,000
00:26:28,000 --> you just add them together so this is a 00:26:30,000
00:26:30,000 --> very handy way of 00:26:32,000
00:26:32,000 --> summarizing the change in the value of 00:26:35,000
00:26:35,000 --> field according to all of these values 00:26:38,000
00:26:38,000 --> and you'll notice that n is the 00:26:39,000
00:26:39,000 --> summation term you have to do this for 00:26:42,000
00:26:42,000 --> all values of n here I'm only having two 00:26:46,000
00:26:46,000 --> dimensions but however many dimensions 00:26:48,000
00:26:48,000 --> you have you need that number of terms 00:26:50,000
00:26:50,000 --> and I'm going to call that equation 00:26:53,000
00:26:53,000 --> number I hope you can see that let's 00:26:56,000
00:26:56,000 --> just write that again equation number 00:26:58,000
00:26:58,000 --> one and I'll put a box around it so that 00:27:02,000
00:27:02,000 --> when we refer to it later you'll be able 00:27:04,000
00:27:04,000 --> to spot it now here comes the general 00:27:08,000
00:27:08,000 --> problem with relativity being special 00:27:11,000
00:27:11,000 --> relativity or general relativity any 00:27:14,000
00:27:14,000 --> rules that you come up with must be 00:27:16,000
00:27:16,000 --> independent of the frame of reference 00:27:19,000
00:27:19,000 --> that you're using to make the 00:27:21,000
00:27:21,000 --> observation in my videos on special 00:27:23,000
00:27:23,000 --> relativity which I will refer to during 00:27:26,000
00:27:26,000 --> the course of this presentation we show 00:27:29,000
00:27:29,000 --> that different observers measure 00:27:31,000
00:27:31,000 --> different distances and different times 00:27:34,000
00:27:34,000 --> depending on their relative velocity 00:27:37,000
00:27:37,000 --> that was called length contraction and 00:27:40,000
00:27:40,000 --> time dilation so if you want to have 00:27:43,000
00:27:43,000 --> something that is going to be 00:27:44,000
00:27:44,000 --> universally true you have to make sure 00:27:47,000
00:27:47,000 --> that it is true in all reference frames 00:27:50,000
00:27:50,000 --> so when I took my field where I was 00:27:55,000
00:27:55,000 --> standing on the hills and I put myself 00:27:57,000
00:27:57,000 --> at position P I set a coordinate system 00:28:01,000
00:28:01,000 --> which I call the XY coordinate system 00:28:05,000
00:28:05,000 --> but subsequently renamed x1 x2 and I 00:28:10,000
00:28:10,000 --> said that was my map reference x1 and x2 00:28:16,000
00:28:16,000 --> define my position but somebody else 00:28:19,000
00:28:19,000 --> could come along and create another set 00:28:22,000
00:28:22,000 --> of coordinates which we will call y1 and 00:28:25,000
00:28:25,000 --> y2 and now P of course I haven't changed 00:28:30,000
00:28:30,000 --> my position I'm still standing on the 00:28:32,000
00:28:32,000 --> hill at position P but as far as the y 00:28:35,000
00:28:35,000 --> frame of reference is concerned the 00:28:38,000
00:28:38,000 --> coordinates are quite different y1 and 00:28:42,000
00:28:42,000 --> y2 are quite different from 00:28:45,000
00:28:45,000 --> x1 and x2 even though I'm at the same 00:28:48,000
00:28:48,000 --> place and you'll notice that if I want 00:28:52,000
00:28:52,000 --> to express y1 in terms of x-coordinates 00:28:59,000
00:28:59,000 --> I have to express it both in terms of an 00:29:02,000
00:29:02,000 --> X 1 coordinate and next to co-ordinate 00:29:06,000
00:29:06,000 --> in other words the y1 position for my 00:29:11,000
00:29:11,000 --> point P is actually made up of an X 1 00:29:15,000
00:29:15,000 --> and then X 2 so the question then that 00:29:19,000
00:29:19,000 --> we have to come up with is if we know if 00:29:22,000
00:29:22,000 --> I know all the gradients which remember 00:29:27,000
00:29:27,000 --> we describe this V Phi by DX in in the X 00:29:32,000
00:29:32,000 --> frame of reference how can we find all 00:29:37,000
00:29:37,000 --> the gradients in the y frame of 00:29:40,000
00:29:40,000 --> reference and more to the point how can 00:29:42,000
00:29:42,000 --> we relate the two and for this we use 00:29:46,000
00:29:46,000 --> what's called the chain rule we say that 00:29:49,000
00:29:49,000 --> / dy and I'm going to pick the y1 00:29:53,000
00:29:53,000 --> coordinate you could pick y2 but I'm 00:29:55,000
00:29:55,000 --> just going to pick Y 1 that is equal now 00:29:58,000
00:29:58,000 --> according to the chain rule that's equal 00:30:00,000
00:30:00,000 --> to defy by the X 1 times DX 1 by dy 1 00:30:06,000
00:30:06,000 --> plus D Phi by DX 2 times the X 2 by dy 1 00:30:15,000
00:30:15,000 --> so you'll notice we're only ever 00:30:17,000
00:30:17,000 --> sticking to the Y 1 coordinate but we 00:30:21,000
00:30:21,000 --> sum over the X 2 coordinates because 00:30:24,000
00:30:24,000 --> remember I said that in order to 00:30:26,000
00:30:26,000 --> identify the Y 1 coordinate you need to 00:30:30,000
00:30:30,000 --> know all of the other x-coordinates this 00:30:34,000
00:30:34,000 --> can be summarized as D Phi by D Y and 00:30:39,000
00:30:39,000 --> now I'm going to call this D Y n because 00:30:41,000
00:30:41,000 --> it could be any could be 1 or 2 in my 00:30:44,000
00:30:44,000 --> two dimensional system and that's going 00:30:47,000
00:30:47,000 --> to be the sum over m of D Phi by DX M 00:30:56,000
00:30:56,000 --> times DX 00:30:58,000
00:30:58,000 --> M by dy n now let's just look at this 00:31:04,000
00:31:04,000 --> and compare it to this what I've done is 00:31:07,000
00:31:07,000 --> I've put the general value of n in for Y 00:31:10,000
00:31:10,000 --> here I just had y1 but it could have 00:31:13,000
00:31:13,000 --> been Y to you have to pick which one you 00:31:15,000
00:31:15,000 --> want it's either one or it's two but M 00:31:19,000
00:31:19,000 --> is a summation term you sum over n when 00:31:23,000
00:31:23,000 --> N is 1 you get that term when M is 2 you 00:31:29,000
00:31:29,000 --> get that term this is going to be 00:31:31,000
00:31:31,000 --> equation number 2 and I'll put a box 00:31:35,000
00:31:35,000 --> around that as well but let me just 00:31:41,000
00:31:41,000 --> repeat and emphasize n is the value you 00:31:45,000
00:31:45,000 --> choose 00:31:45,000
00:31:45,000 --> it's either y1 or it's y2 you make the 00:31:49,000
00:31:49,000 --> choice but M is a summation term you 00:31:52,000
00:31:52,000 --> have to sum over all the values of X 00:31:55,000
00:31:55,000 --> just to get one of the values with 00:31:58,000
00:31:58,000 --> respect to Y now I want to introduce you 00:32:01,000
00:32:01,000 --> to the concept of tensors we mentioned 00:32:04,000
00:32:04,000 --> that when we looked at the Einstein 00:32:07,000
00:32:07,000 --> field equations there were several 00:32:09,000
00:32:09,000 --> tensors what is a tensor well let me 00:32:12,000
00:32:12,000 --> start off by talking about a scalar a 00:32:15,000
00:32:15,000 --> scalar is something that has magnitude 00:32:17,000
00:32:17,000 --> but no direction temperature would be a 00:32:20,000
00:32:20,000 --> good example of a scalar it just has a 00:32:22,000
00:32:22,000 --> value 32 degrees centigrade a scalar is 00:32:28,000
00:32:28,000 --> what's called a tensor of Rank 0 now 00:32:34,000
00:32:34,000 --> consider a vector a vector of course has 00:32:37,000
00:32:37,000 --> magnitude and direction so it has a 00:32:41,000
00:32:41,000 --> length and it has a direction which is 00:32:44,000
00:32:44,000 --> often described as the angle to one of 00:32:46,000
00:32:46,000 --> the axes in this case to the x-axis and 00:32:50,000
00:32:50,000 --> a vector is described as a tensor of 00:32:55,000
00:32:55,000 --> Rank 1 and how does a vector transform 00:33:00,000
00:33:00,000 --> well we can use equation 1 that we 00:33:03,000
00:33:03,000 --> derived earlier and which is showing on 00:33:05,000
00:33:05,000 --> the screen so you recognize it and we 00:33:07,000
00:33:07,000 --> just make a slight adjustment to 00:33:09,000
00:33:09,000 --> so that instead of D Phi and D X we 00:33:13,000
00:33:13,000 --> replace it by the vectors themselves so 00:33:16,000
00:33:16,000 --> we would simply say that the vector in 00:33:18,000
00:33:18,000 --> the Y frame of reference and with the Co 00:33:22,000
00:33:22,000 --> ordinate n which we choose is equal to 00:33:27,000
00:33:27,000 --> the sum over m where m is now the 00:33:30,000
00:33:30,000 --> summation term of the as it were 00:33:35,000
00:33:35,000 --> gradient which is dy n over the X M 00:33:39,000
00:33:39,000 --> where m is the summation term times the 00:33:43,000
00:33:43,000 --> vector in the x frame of reference M so 00:33:48,000
00:33:48,000 --> that is the way in which we and I shall 00:33:51,000
00:33:51,000 --> call that equation number 3 that's the 00:33:59,000
00:33:59,000 --> way vectors transform we're using 00:34:01,000
00:34:01,000 --> equation 1 that we derived and modifying 00:34:04,000
00:34:04,000 --> it slightly that the vector in the wall 00:34:06,000
00:34:06,000 --> rather the length coordinate of the 00:34:09,000
00:34:09,000 --> vector in the Y frame of reference is 00:34:12,000
00:34:12,000 --> equal to the sum of the of this gradient 00:34:15,000
00:34:15,000 --> term times the M where m is summed of 00:34:19,000
00:34:19,000 --> course coordinate in the X frame of 00:34:22,000
00:34:22,000 --> reference and you have to sum over these 00:34:25,000
00:34:25,000 --> terms in order to get the enth 00:34:28,000
00:34:28,000 --> coordinate in the y frame of reference 00:34:32,000
00:34:32,000 --> the tensors that we will be interested 00:34:35,000
00:34:35,000 --> in are tensors of rank two and what a 00:34:39,000
00:34:39,000 --> tense of rank two is is a combination of 00:34:42,000
00:34:42,000 --> vectors where there is a fixed 00:34:45,000
00:34:45,000 --> relationship between the two so let's 00:34:50,000
00:34:50,000 --> just think of some system which has a 00:34:53,000
00:34:53,000 --> combination of vectors let's take a very 00:34:56,000
00:34:56,000 --> simple one let's put a block on the 00:34:59,000
00:34:59,000 --> floor and we're going to apply a force 00:35:02,000
00:35:02,000 --> to it in order to move the block a 00:35:06,000
00:35:06,000 --> certain distance X in this direction and 00:35:11,000
00:35:11,000 --> the work done will be the force times 00:35:16,000
00:35:16,000 --> the distance but of course we can't just 00:35:20,000
00:35:20,000 --> take the force we have to take the 00:35:22,000
00:35:22,000 --> component 00:35:23,000
00:35:23,000 --> of the force that is moving in the 00:35:27,000
00:35:27,000 --> direction we want to go so if that angle 00:35:30,000
00:35:30,000 --> is alpha then the component of the force 00:35:34,000
00:35:34,000 --> acting in the direction of movement is F 00:35:37,000
00:35:37,000 --> cosine alpha so the work done will be 00:35:43,000
00:35:43,000 --> the component of the force that's in the 00:35:45,000
00:35:45,000 --> direction we want to move times the 00:35:48,000
00:35:48,000 --> distance we travel and you can think of 00:35:50,000
00:35:50,000 --> F and X as being vectors X has a 00:35:55,000
00:35:55,000 --> magnitude and the direction the 00:35:57,000
00:35:57,000 --> direction is in the X Direction F has a 00:36:00,000
00:36:00,000 --> component that has a magnitude and a 00:36:03,000
00:36:03,000 --> direction the component at least of 00:36:05,000
00:36:05,000 --> force in the X direction it has 00:36:08,000
00:36:08,000 --> magnitude and direction so we've got 00:36:10,000
00:36:10,000 --> essentially something which combines two 00:36:13,000
00:36:13,000 --> vectors now the question is suppose the 00:36:18,000
00:36:18,000 --> force is in that direction 00:36:22,000
00:36:22,000 --> then the angle alpha will be 90 degrees 00:36:26,000
00:36:26,000 --> and the cosine of alpha is zero and 00:36:31,000
00:36:31,000 --> therefore the work done will be zero 00:36:35,000
00:36:35,000 --> because of course the block won't move 00:36:37,000
00:36:37,000 --> if you're pushing down on the block 00:36:39,000
00:36:39,000 --> you're not going to get it to move in 00:36:41,000
00:36:41,000 --> the X direction and here's the thing but 00:36:46,000
00:36:46,000 --> it doesn't matter what frame of 00:36:47,000
00:36:47,000 --> reference you apply to this system 00:36:51,000
00:36:51,000 --> whatever frame of reference you apply 00:36:53,000
00:36:53,000 --> that block will not move the value of 00:36:58,000
00:36:58,000 --> the work done will be zero in all frames 00:37:01,000
00:37:01,000 --> of reference and that's the value of a 00:37:04,000
00:37:04,000 --> tensor a tensor is the relationship 00:37:07,000
00:37:07,000 --> between two vectors and if the 00:37:09,000
00:37:09,000 --> relationship if the tensor has a value 00:37:12,000
00:37:12,000 --> of zero in one frame of reference 00:37:14,000
00:37:14,000 --> it must have a value of zero in all 00:37:19,000
00:37:19,000 --> frames of reference if that block 00:37:21,000
00:37:21,000 --> doesn't move it doesn't move it doesn't 00:37:24,000
00:37:24,000 --> matter what frame of reference you apply 00:37:26,000
00:37:26,000 --> to observe it it doesn't move tensors 00:37:29,000
00:37:29,000 --> therefore our relationships between 00:37:31,000
00:37:31,000 --> fixed relationships between two vectors 00:37:33,000
00:37:33,000 --> in such a way that if that 00:37:36,000
00:37:36,000 --> lationship equals zero in one frame of 00:37:37,000
00:37:37,000 --> reference it equals zero in all frames 00:37:40,000
00:37:40,000 --> of reference and that is why tensors are 00:37:42,000
00:37:42,000 --> so important in einstein field equations 00:37:46,000
00:37:46,000 --> so let's consider a combination of 00:37:49,000
00:37:49,000 --> vectors doesn't matter what it is for 00:37:51,000
00:37:51,000 --> these purposes we're going to take 00:37:52,000
00:37:52,000 --> vector a and we're going to take the 00:37:55,000
00:37:55,000 --> length coordinate of that vector 00:37:59,000
00:37:59,000 --> remember there are dimensions in space I 00:38:02,000
00:38:02,000 --> am actually using only two dimensions 00:38:04,000
00:38:04,000 --> for this simplistic analysis so M is 00:38:06,000
00:38:06,000 --> either one or two you choose which one 00:38:09,000
00:38:09,000 --> you want it to be and we take another 00:38:11,000
00:38:11,000 --> vector B and we'll take the nth 00:38:14,000
00:38:14,000 --> co-ordinate that can be one or two you 00:38:17,000
00:38:17,000 --> choose and we say that the combination 00:38:20,000
00:38:20,000 --> of the two becomes a tensor of Rank 2 00:38:25,000
00:38:25,000 --> which we indicate by saying that it has 00:38:28,000
00:38:28,000 --> those two coordinates M or two indices m 00:38:32,000
00:38:32,000 --> and N equals the vector a with the 00:38:37,000
00:38:37,000 --> coordinate or the dimension M and chord 00:38:41,000
00:38:41,000 --> and vector B with the nth dimension so 00:38:46,000
00:38:46,000 --> obviously if there are if I'm talking 00:38:49,000
00:38:49,000 --> about two dimensional space where M can 00:38:51,000
00:38:51,000 --> be either 1 or 2 and n can be 1 or 2 00:38:54,000
00:38:54,000 --> then T MN there can be 4 versions of 00:38:58,000
00:38:58,000 --> that tensor where m and M each have 00:39:01,000
00:39:01,000 --> values 1 and 2 if you've got three 00:39:04,000
00:39:04,000 --> dimensions of space m and n can each 00:39:08,000
00:39:08,000 --> have values 1 2 3 and so t MN has nine 00:39:12,000
00:39:12,000 --> different versions if there are four 00:39:15,000
00:39:15,000 --> dimensions of space time one time three 00:39:18,000
00:39:18,000 --> dimensions t MN will have 16 different 00:39:22,000
00:39:22,000 --> values well now I'm going to use 00:39:26,000
00:39:26,000 --> equation three that we derived earlier 00:39:28,000
00:39:28,000 --> and which should be showing on the 00:39:30,000
00:39:30,000 --> screen to take the vectors a and B so 00:39:35,000
00:39:35,000 --> we're going to take a.m. in the y frame 00:39:38,000
00:39:38,000 --> of reference and B M in the y frame of 00:39:41,000
00:39:41,000 --> reference and we're going to try and see 00:39:44,000
00:39:44,000 --> what they are in the x frame of 00:39:46,000
00:39:46,000 --> reference using equation three 00:39:49,000
00:39:49,000 --> well you can see that we've just got to 00:39:51,000
00:39:51,000 --> replace V in equation three by a and 00:39:54,000
00:39:54,000 --> then B so let's do a first of all we 00:39:59,000
00:39:59,000 --> need a some term I can't use em anymore 00:40:02,000
00:40:02,000 --> because that's already been used here so 00:40:03,000
00:40:03,000 --> I'll just introduce a value R remember 00:40:06,000
00:40:06,000 --> this is a summation term it's called a 00:40:08,000
00:40:08,000 --> dummy variable it doesn't matter what 00:40:09,000
00:40:09,000 --> you put and that's going to be dy m by 00:40:14,000
00:40:14,000 --> DX ah times a in the X frame of 00:40:20,000
00:40:20,000 --> reference ah that does the vector a and 00:40:24,000
00:40:24,000 --> now we need to do the vector B in the X 00:40:27,000
00:40:27,000 --> frame of reference which again from 00:40:29,000
00:40:29,000 --> Equation three comes 00:40:30,000
00:40:30,000 --> I now need another summation term it's 00:40:33,000
00:40:33,000 --> called it s and that's going to be dy n 00:40:37,000
00:40:37,000 --> by the X s times B in the X frame of 00:40:43,000
00:40:43,000 --> reference s so you sum over the are 00:40:47,000
00:40:47,000 --> terms and you sum over the S terms but m 00:40:51,000
00:40:51,000 --> and n are chosen they're the values you 00:40:54,000
00:40:54,000 --> happen to choose for this particular 00:40:56,000
00:40:56,000 --> equation well let's look and see what 00:40:59,000
00:40:59,000 --> this reduces to firstly am BN well 00:41:03,000
00:41:03,000 --> that's just the tensor t MN in the y 00:41:08,000
00:41:08,000 --> frame of reference because that's what 00:41:10,000
00:41:10,000 --> we selected here and that is going to be 00:41:12,000
00:41:12,000 --> equal to the sum over R and s and that's 00:41:17,000
00:41:17,000 --> not quite the right way to do it but 00:41:18,000
00:41:18,000 --> essentially you've got to some terms 00:41:20,000
00:41:20,000 --> here which I'm just going to simplify 00:41:22,000
00:41:22,000 --> here x dy M by the X R and then you've 00:41:29,000
00:41:29,000 --> got a dy in DX s times a X R B X s 00:41:40,000
00:41:40,000 --> that's that term and that term but what 00:41:44,000
00:41:44,000 --> is this well if you look at this term up 00:41:47,000
00:41:47,000 --> here you'll see that it's just another 00:41:49,000
00:41:49,000 --> tensor in this case it's the tensor in 00:41:52,000
00:41:52,000 --> the X frame of reference but its indices 00:41:57,000
00:41:57,000 --> are R and s and that I'm going to call 00:42:02,000
00:42:02,000 --> equation four and I'll put a block 00:42:06,000
00:42:06,000 --> around that because we may need that in 00:42:09,000
00:42:09,000 --> the future and that is called it gets a 00:42:14,000
00:42:14,000 --> technical term it's called the 00:42:16,000
00:42:16,000 --> contravariant transformation it's the 00:42:20,000
00:42:20,000 --> transformation from the y frame of 00:42:23,000
00:42:23,000 --> reference to the x frame of reference 00:42:25,000
00:42:25,000 --> for tensors there is an equivalent form 00:42:30,000
00:42:30,000 --> of tensor transformation that is called 00:42:32,000
00:42:32,000 --> the covariant transformation where the 00:42:36,000
00:42:36,000 --> indices which instead of being upstairs 00:42:39,000
00:42:39,000 --> go downstairs 00:42:41,000
00:42:41,000 --> but then the dy by the X terms are 00:42:46,000
00:42:46,000 --> changed into DX by dy terms so let me 00:42:50,000
00:42:50,000 --> just write that out you get the T and 00:42:53,000
00:42:53,000 --> now it's in the Y frame of reference but 00:42:56,000
00:42:56,000 --> the M&N; go downstairs so I'll put the 00:42:59,000
00:42:59,000 --> M&N; down here and to make it clear I'll 00:43:02,000
00:43:02,000 --> put Y in brackets so TMM in the y frame 00:43:05,000
00:43:05,000 --> of reference are equal to again you've 00:43:08,000
00:43:08,000 --> got this summation term over R and s and 00:43:12,000
00:43:12,000 --> now these two terms just go upside down 00:43:16,000
00:43:16,000 --> DX R by dy M DX s by dy n just inverting 00:43:24,000
00:43:24,000 --> these terms here and then the tensor 00:43:27,000
00:43:27,000 --> terms again goes downstairs but it's in 00:43:30,000
00:43:30,000 --> the X frame of reference and that is 00:43:34,000
00:43:34,000 --> called the covariant transformation and 00:43:39,000
00:43:39,000 --> to call that equation number five so 00:43:41,000
00:43:41,000 --> this is called the contravariant this is 00:43:45,000
00:43:45,000 --> called the covariant contravariant had 00:43:48,000
00:43:48,000 --> the indices upstairs covariant have the 00:43:52,000
00:43:52,000 --> indices downstairs contravariant have dy 00:43:56,000
00:43:56,000 --> by the X terms covariant had DX by dy 00:44:00,000
00:44:00,000 --> terms and it is actually the covariant 00:44:03,000
00:44:03,000 --> form of transformation that is going to 00:44:06,000
00:44:06,000 --> be of interest to us now I want to do a 00:44:09,000
00:44:09,000 --> little bit of manipulation with 00:44:11,000
00:44:11,000 --> something as basic as pythagoras 00:44:13,000
00:44:13,000 --> pythagoras applies to a 00:44:16,000
00:44:16,000 --> right angled triangle and if this is dx1 00:44:20,000
00:44:20,000 --> using our frame of reference in the X 00:44:24,000
00:44:24,000 --> frame of reference and this is x2 this 00:44:28,000
00:44:28,000 --> is the s the hypotenuse then of course 00:44:32,000
00:44:32,000 --> you can easily say that according to 00:44:35,000
00:44:35,000 --> Pythagoras D s squared is equal to DX 1 00:44:39,000
00:44:39,000 --> squared plus DX 2 squared and if there 00:44:44,000
00:44:44,000 --> were further dimensions you would have 00:44:46,000
00:44:46,000 --> it plus DX 3 squared and so on 00:44:49,000
00:44:49,000 --> and your agree with you not that that is 00:44:53,000
00:44:53,000 --> simply the summation over m of DX m 00:44:58,000
00:44:58,000 --> times DX m in other words when m is 1 00:45:03,000
00:45:03,000 --> you get DX 1 squared that's that term 00:45:07,000
00:45:07,000 --> when M is 2 you get DX M you get DX M is 00:45:12,000
00:45:12,000 --> 2 DX 2 all squared that's to that term 00:45:16,000
00:45:16,000 --> if M were 3 you would get the further 00:45:18,000
00:45:18,000 --> term DX 3 squared now I'm going to make 00:45:24,000
00:45:24,000 --> it a little bit more complicated but 00:45:26,000
00:45:26,000 --> you'll see why of course in a minute 00:45:28,000
00:45:28,000 --> that means that D s squared is equal to 00:45:33,000
00:45:33,000 --> the sum over m and n what am i doing of 00:45:40,000
00:45:40,000 --> DX m times DX n now you will say no that 00:45:47,000
00:45:47,000 --> cannot be right because there is no 00:45:51,000
00:45:51,000 --> combination of DX 1 DX 2 in Pythagoras 00:45:54,000
00:45:54,000 --> there is only DX 1 squared and DX 2 00:45:57,000
00:45:57,000 --> squared if you do this you're going to 00:46:00,000
00:46:00,000 --> get a DX 1 DX 2 term and we don't need 00:46:03,000
00:46:03,000 --> it 00:46:04,000
00:46:04,000 --> perfectly true so we add a further term 00:46:07,000
00:46:07,000 --> which is called Delta M N and that term 00:46:12,000
00:46:12,000 --> is called the Kronecker Delta and the 00:46:15,000
00:46:15,000 --> thing about the Kronecker Delta is it 00:46:17,000
00:46:17,000 --> has the value of 1 if M equals in and it 00:46:22,000
00:46:22,000 --> has the value of 0 if M does not equal n 00:46:26,000
00:46:26,000 --> so when M 00:46:28,000
00:46:28,000 --> n then you simply get the squared terms 00:46:31,000
00:46:31,000 --> that you want when M does not equal M 00:46:35,000
00:46:35,000 --> then this whole term becomes 0 because 00:46:39,000
00:46:39,000 --> Delta MN is 0 so if M does not equal n 00:46:43,000
00:46:43,000 --> all the cross terms come out and we'll 00:46:47,000
00:46:47,000 --> need that approach it's a very 00:46:49,000
00:46:49,000 --> complicated way of describing Pythagoras 00:46:52,000
00:46:52,000 --> Delta MN remembers the clinica Delta it 00:46:55,000
00:46:55,000 --> equals 1 if M equals n it equals 0 if M 00:46:59,000
00:46:59,000 --> does not equal N and therefore avoids 00:47:02,000
00:47:02,000 --> any of the dx1 dx2 terms that you don't 00:47:06,000
00:47:06,000 --> need in Pythagoras so I've rewritten 00:47:09,000
00:47:09,000 --> that formula that we just derived I've 00:47:11,000
00:47:11,000 --> simply put the chronica Delta at the 00:47:13,000
00:47:13,000 --> beginning rather than at the end it 00:47:14,000
00:47:14,000 --> doesn't matter where it goes and now I 00:47:17,000
00:47:17,000 --> want to remind you of equation one that 00:47:20,000
00:47:20,000 --> we derived and which should be on the 00:47:22,000
00:47:22,000 --> screen and I'm going to rewrite that in 00:47:24,000
00:47:24,000 --> a slightly different form I'm going to 00:47:26,000
00:47:26,000 --> say that DX m is equal to DX m by dy R 00:47:33,000
00:47:33,000 --> times dy bar and you'll notice that the 00:47:38,000
00:47:38,000 --> difference is that instead of Phi in 00:47:40,000
00:47:40,000 --> equation one I've used X M instead of 00:47:45,000
00:47:45,000 --> using M as the dummy summation term I've 00:47:49,000
00:47:49,000 --> used ah and I've changed round the x and 00:47:55,000
00:47:55,000 --> y-coordinates there's no reason why I 00:47:58,000
00:47:58,000 --> shouldn't do that so now I'm going to 00:48:00,000
00:48:00,000 --> take the value of DX m which is this 00:48:03,000
00:48:03,000 --> according to equation 1 and substitute 00:48:06,000
00:48:06,000 --> it in this equation here and then I'll 00:48:09,000
00:48:09,000 --> do the same for DX n so what I'm going 00:48:13,000
00:48:13,000 --> to get is that D s squared is equal to 00:48:16,000
00:48:16,000 --> Delta MN which is this term here plus 00:48:19,000
00:48:19,000 --> the summation term which we don't need 00:48:22,000
00:48:22,000 --> to worry too much about Einstein 00:48:24,000
00:48:24,000 --> actually dropped it he said it was 00:48:25,000
00:48:25,000 --> implicit he didn't even bother to put it 00:48:27,000
00:48:27,000 --> in but I'll just keep it there to show 00:48:29,000
00:48:29,000 --> that there is a summation going on and 00:48:31,000
00:48:31,000 --> then instead of DX M I'm going to put 00:48:34,000
00:48:34,000 --> this term here which is d X M by dy R 00:48:39,000
00:48:39,000 --> times dy R 00:48:41,000
00:48:41,000 --> and then we're going to multiply by dxn 00:48:44,000
00:48:44,000 --> which I'm going to put the equivalent 00:48:45,000
00:48:45,000 --> version here which is going to be DX and 00:48:47,000
00:48:47,000 --> by dy I now need another summation term 00:48:51,000
00:48:51,000 --> call it s times dy s so this term is 00:48:56,000
00:48:56,000 --> simply this term equals this this term 00:49:00,000
00:49:00,000 --> is this term modified equals this and 00:49:04,000
00:49:04,000 --> now I can rearrange that so that I can 00:49:08,000
00:49:08,000 --> say that D s squared is equal to Delta M 00:49:11,000
00:49:11,000 --> n we need a summation term let's just 00:49:14,000
00:49:14,000 --> bring the two gradients together DX M by 00:49:18,000
00:49:18,000 --> dy r DX n by dy s and that leaves us 00:49:24,000
00:49:24,000 --> these two terms here dy r dy s and 00:49:30,000
00:49:30,000 --> that's as it were a form of Pythagoras 00:49:34,000
00:49:34,000 --> but this term here is called the metric 00:49:43,000
00:49:43,000 --> tensor it's G M N and if you look you'll 00:49:48,000
00:49:48,000 --> see that there's an equivalence with 00:49:50,000
00:49:50,000 --> what we derived up here as pythagoras 00:49:52,000
00:49:52,000 --> pythagoras was simply the summation term 00:49:55,000
00:49:55,000 --> with a chronicle delta which made sure 00:49:57,000
00:49:57,000 --> you didn't get any cross terms here 00:50:00,000
00:50:00,000 --> we've got exactly the same thing we've 00:50:02,000
00:50:02,000 --> got d r squared is equal to combination 00:50:05,000
00:50:05,000 --> of these two elements here but instead 00:50:08,000
00:50:08,000 --> of having just a simple chronica delta 00:50:10,000
00:50:10,000 --> we've now got a more complicated metric 00:50:13,000
00:50:13,000 --> tensor so we can now write that d s 00:50:17,000
00:50:17,000 --> squared is equal to the metric tensor g 00:50:21,000
00:50:21,000 --> MN times dy r dy s and of course there's 00:50:29,000
00:50:29,000 --> a sum a sh gM contains a summation term 00:50:32,000
00:50:32,000 --> for flat space it's pretty obvious that 00:50:36,000
00:50:36,000 --> g MN is simply gonna reduce to the 00:50:39,000
00:50:39,000 --> Kronecker Delta term that should be d m 00:50:42,000
00:50:42,000 --> n Delta MN so it will be 1 when R equals 00:50:49,000
00:50:49,000 --> s and it will be 0 when R doesn't equal 00:50:54,000
00:50:54,000 --> so for flatspace the metric tensor will 00:50:59,000
00:50:59,000 --> either be 1 or 0 depending on where the 00:51:03,000
00:51:03,000 --> R equals s or not but here's the rub 00:51:07,000
00:51:07,000 --> suppose you aren't in flat space in flat 00:51:10,000
00:51:10,000 --> space it is perfectly true that if 00:51:16,000
00:51:16,000 --> that's DX 1 and DX 2 and that's d s it 00:51:20,000
00:51:20,000 --> is true in flat space that D s squared 00:51:23,000
00:51:23,000 --> equals DX 1 squared plus DX 2 squared 00:51:28,000
00:51:28,000 --> that's Pythagoras in flat space but that 00:51:32,000
00:51:32,000 --> is not true if you take a sphere and you 00:51:38,000
00:51:38,000 --> try to draw a triangle on the surface of 00:51:41,000
00:51:41,000 --> a sphere on the surface then this 00:51:46,000
00:51:46,000 --> formula which we derived which is just 00:51:49,000
00:51:49,000 --> lame Pythagoras that is not true on the 00:51:53,000
00:51:53,000 --> surface of a sphere and how do you make 00:51:56,000
00:51:56,000 --> the correction for that surface you make 00:51:59,000
00:51:59,000 --> the correction by introducing this 00:52:01,000
00:52:01,000 --> metric tensor so if you like you can 00:52:04,000
00:52:04,000 --> think of the metric tensor as the device 00:52:07,000
00:52:07,000 --> which makes corrections to pythagoras 00:52:11,000
00:52:11,000 --> when you have got the right angle 00:52:14,000
00:52:14,000 --> triangle on a curved space instead of a 00:52:19,000
00:52:19,000 --> flat space so you can begin to see the 00:52:23,000
00:52:23,000 --> value of the metric tensor if we're 00:52:25,000
00:52:25,000 --> going to talk about curved space-time so 00:52:28,000
00:52:28,000 --> here is the einstein field equations or 00:52:31,000
00:52:31,000 --> here are the einstein field equations 00:52:33,000
00:52:33,000 --> and the g mu nu terms are the metric 00:52:37,000
00:52:37,000 --> tensors we just derived why have they 00:52:40,000
00:52:40,000 --> got mu nu instead of em n the answer is 00:52:43,000
00:52:43,000 --> that you use mu nu when you also include 00:52:46,000
00:52:46,000 --> space-time what I just derived was 00:52:49,000
00:52:49,000 --> solely associated with space m and n if 00:52:52,000
00:52:52,000 --> you want to introduce time as well then 00:52:56,000
00:52:56,000 --> you say mu nu where mu can now be either 00:52:59,000
00:52:59,000 --> 0 which means that's the time component 00:53:01,000
00:53:01,000 --> or 1 2 3 which are the three space 00:53:05,000
00:53:05,000 --> components 00:53:06,000
00:53:06,000 --> so that is the metric tensor and you may 00:53:09,000
00:53:09,000 --> now like to take another break okay we 00:53:13,000
00:53:13,000 --> now proceed to part three the 00:53:16,000
00:53:16,000 --> Christoffel symbols now you'll remember 00:53:19,000
00:53:19,000 --> that I said that the important thing 00:53:21,000
00:53:21,000 --> about tensors was that they represent a 00:53:23,000
00:53:23,000 --> fixed relationship between two vectors 00:53:26,000
00:53:26,000 --> and they are independent of the 00:53:29,000
00:53:29,000 --> coordinate system in particular if one 00:53:33,000
00:53:33,000 --> tensor is zero in one coordinate system 00:53:36,000
00:53:36,000 --> it will be zero in all coordinate 00:53:39,000
00:53:39,000 --> systems so let's suppose that we have a 00:53:43,000
00:53:43,000 --> tensor it's called it W and we'll take 00:53:46,000
00:53:46,000 --> the N and M coordinates in the X frame 00:53:51,000
00:53:51,000 --> of reference and we'll say that that is 00:53:53,000
00:53:53,000 --> equal to another tensor also with N and 00:53:57,000
00:53:57,000 --> M coordinates in the X frame of 00:54:00,000
00:54:00,000 --> reference if that is true in the X frame 00:54:03,000
00:54:03,000 --> of reference it must be true in all 00:54:06,000
00:54:06,000 --> frames of reference to take my example 00:54:10,000
00:54:10,000 --> of the field right at the beginning if 00:54:12,000
00:54:12,000 --> the height of the field is 2 meters it 00:54:15,000
00:54:15,000 --> matters not what frame of reference 00:54:17,000
00:54:17,000 --> you're talking about it will always be 2 00:54:20,000
00:54:20,000 --> meters but here's the problem the 00:54:24,000
00:54:24,000 --> problem is that the derivatives of 00:54:26,000
00:54:26,000 --> tensors do not necessarily transform 00:54:30,000
00:54:30,000 --> between frames of reference and we're 00:54:33,000
00:54:33,000 --> going to need derivatives of tensors so 00:54:36,000
00:54:36,000 --> we need to know what goes wrong so let's 00:54:40,000
00:54:40,000 --> take a tensor in the X frame of 00:54:42,000
00:54:42,000 --> reference which we'll call t m in in the 00:54:46,000
00:54:46,000 --> x frame of reference and let's say that 00:54:48,000
00:54:48,000 --> that equals the derivative of a vector V 00:54:55,000
00:54:55,000 --> with respect to N in the X frame of 00:54:59,000
00:54:59,000 --> reference now the question is does that 00:55:03,000
00:55:03,000 --> same tensor in the y frame of reference 00:55:07,000
00:55:07,000 --> equal the derivative of the vector M 00:55:14,000
00:55:14,000 --> with respect to Y in the Y frame of 00:55:18,000
00:55:18,000 --> reference is 00:55:19,000
00:55:19,000 --> that true so the answer is no sadly and 00:55:23,000
00:55:23,000 --> we'll find out why I'm going back to 00:55:26,000
00:55:26,000 --> equation five which should appear on the 00:55:29,000
00:55:29,000 --> screen but I'm just going to rewrite it 00:55:30,000
00:55:30,000 --> exactly as it was that the tensor T my a 00:55:36,000
00:55:36,000 --> TM n in the y frame of reference is 00:55:38,000
00:55:38,000 --> equal to the XR by dy m times DX s by dy 00:55:48,000
00:55:48,000 --> n times t RS in the x frame of reference 00:55:55,000
00:55:55,000 --> that was just equation five 00:55:57,000
00:55:57,000 --> I dropped you'll notice the summation 00:55:59,000
00:55:59,000 --> term just as Einstein did and the s and 00:56:03,000
00:56:03,000 --> our terms are dummy variables you need 00:56:07,000
00:56:07,000 --> to sum over them but let's drop the the 00:56:09,000
00:56:09,000 --> the summation term well let's just 00:56:14,000
00:56:14,000 --> rewrite that that is going to be I'm 00:56:16,000
00:56:16,000 --> just going to rewrite this these terms 00:56:18,000
00:56:18,000 --> here DX r by dy m times DX s times dy n 00:56:24,000
00:56:24,000 --> but instead of TR s in the X frame of 00:56:28,000
00:56:28,000 --> reference I'm going to write use this 00:56:32,000
00:56:32,000 --> term here but of course in shape I'm 00:56:34,000
00:56:34,000 --> going to change em and end to R and s so 00:56:38,000
00:56:38,000 --> this now becomes from the equation above 00:56:41,000
00:56:41,000 --> D V R X divided by or is it work with 00:56:49,000
00:56:49,000 --> respect to DX s I've simply written t RS 00:56:55,000
00:56:55,000 --> in this form here a DV by DX term now if 00:57:02,000
00:57:02,000 --> you look at that combination of tones 00:57:06,000
00:57:06,000 --> there you've got what is essentially the 00:57:08,000
00:57:08,000 --> inverse of the chain rule this is a DX s 00:57:12,000
00:57:12,000 --> term V is this is a DX s term you can in 00:57:16,000
00:57:16,000 --> a sense contract this so it simply 00:57:19,000
00:57:19,000 --> becomes DV R by D Y N and so you get the 00:57:25,000
00:57:25,000 --> T M and Y which is what we're trying to 00:57:28,000
00:57:28,000 --> calculate so T MN in the y frame of 00:57:33,000
00:57:33,000 --> reference is equal to this term here DX 00:57:37,000
00:57:37,000 --> R by dy M times this contracted which is 00:57:43,000
00:57:43,000 --> just DB R by D Y so this DV are in the x 00:57:48,000
00:57:48,000 --> frame of reference / devo dy n and the 00:57:55,000
00:57:55,000 --> question we want to ask is does that 00:58:00,000
00:58:00,000 --> equal 00:58:03,000
00:58:03,000 --> DVM by dy n in the y frame of reference 00:58:08,000
00:58:08,000 --> so does it equal equal question mark 00:58:12,000
00:58:12,000 --> does it equal because we don't know 00:58:14,000
00:58:14,000 --> whether it does DVM in the y frame of 00:58:18,000
00:58:18,000 --> reference by dy n well what is this term 00:58:25,000
00:58:25,000 --> DVM by D Y n let's just write that out 00:58:31,000
00:58:31,000 --> the V M by dy n I'm going to use 00:58:38,000
00:58:38,000 --> equation 5 which is actually a tensor 00:58:41,000
00:58:41,000 --> term but remember tensors you can reduce 00:58:42,000
00:58:42,000 --> two vectors just by dropping one of the 00:58:44,000
00:58:44,000 --> indices and if you just do it for a 00:58:47,000
00:58:47,000 --> single index and you can see that dy DV 00:58:53,000
00:58:53,000 --> M by dy n is actually equal to the 00:58:58,000
00:58:58,000 --> derivative of with respect to Y n of DX 00:59:06,000
00:59:06,000 --> r by dy m times V R in the X frame of 00:59:15,000
00:59:15,000 --> reference that is what DV m by dy n is 00:59:20,000
00:59:20,000 --> if you take it from Equation number five 00:59:24,000
00:59:24,000 --> but looking at it only with one index 00:59:28,000
00:59:28,000 --> but this is a differentiation of a 00:59:31,000
00:59:31,000 --> product and you should know that if you 00:59:34,000
00:59:34,000 --> differentiate a product let's 00:59:35,000
00:59:35,000 --> differentiate a times B then the 00:59:39,000
00:59:39,000 --> differential of a product will be a 00:59:40,000
00:59:40,000 --> times D B plus B times D 00:59:45,000
00:59:45,000 --> a so if this is a and this is B then the 00:59:50,000
00:59:50,000 --> differential of that differential of a B 00:59:53,000
00:59:53,000 --> will equal so we've now got that DVM y 00:59:59,000
00:59:59,000 --> by the Y n which is this term here is 01:00:02,000
01:00:02,000 --> equal to a DB which is DX R by D Y M 01:00:10,000
01:00:10,000 --> times DB which is D V R in the X frame 01:00:17,000
01:00:17,000 --> by dy n that's d B plus B which is V R X 01:00:27,000
01:00:27,000 --> which will stick out here times da which 01:00:34,000
01:00:34,000 --> is the combination of these two 01:00:36,000
01:00:36,000 --> differentials so we've got D by dy n 01:00:42,000
01:00:42,000 --> times DX R by dy m D that's that 01:00:49,000
01:00:49,000 --> combination there now observe that this 01:00:54,000
01:00:54,000 --> term here is equal to this term here TM 01:01:04,000
01:01:04,000 --> n y equals that term there and we were 01:01:08,000
01:01:08,000 --> asking does that term there equal this 01:01:12,000
01:01:12,000 --> term and this term equals yes we've got 01:01:17,000
01:01:17,000 --> exactly the same answer that we wanted 01:01:19,000
01:01:19,000 --> those two are exactly the same except 01:01:23,000
01:01:23,000 --> there's an additional term here so 01:01:27,000
01:01:27,000 --> actually they are not equal we've got 01:01:29,000
01:01:29,000 --> this additional thing here and that 01:01:32,000
01:01:32,000 --> combination of differentials just that 01:01:37,000
01:01:37,000 --> little combination there is called gamma 01:01:42,000
01:01:42,000 --> capital gamma it's actually given the 01:01:45,000
01:01:45,000 --> title the Christoffel symbol and we 01:01:49,000
01:01:49,000 --> represent the indices that appear here 01:01:51,000
01:01:51,000 --> by putting since there's an R upstairs 01:01:54,000
01:01:54,000 --> we'll put an R upstairs and since 01:01:56,000
01:01:56,000 --> there's an N and an end 01:01:58,000
01:01:58,000 --> downstairs we'll put an N and the name 01:02:00,000
01:02:00,000 --> downstairs so that symbol that 01:02:02,000
01:02:02,000 --> Christoffel symbol that capital gamma is 01:02:05,000
01:02:05,000 --> simply a shorthand way of writing this 01:02:08,000
01:02:08,000 --> double differential pair it's the extra 01:02:12,000
01:02:12,000 --> term that says that those two things are 01:02:15,000
01:02:15,000 --> not equal in other words let's just make 01:02:18,000
01:02:18,000 --> it clear what we asked was does TM n in 01:02:23,000
01:02:23,000 --> the y frame of reference equal DVM by D 01:02:30,000
01:02:30,000 --> Y N and the answer was no it doesn't 01:02:36,000
01:02:36,000 --> because there's that extra term and the 01:02:40,000
01:02:40,000 --> way we get round that extra term is we 01:02:43,000
01:02:43,000 --> say that t MN y does equal a new concept 01:02:50,000
01:02:50,000 --> which we will call the covariant 01:02:52,000
01:02:52,000 --> derivative that's what that symbol means 01:02:55,000
01:02:55,000 --> of the M so it's not the ordinary 01:03:01,000
01:03:01,000 --> derivative we shown it was not we're 01:03:03,000
01:03:03,000 --> gonna call it the covariant derivative 01:03:05,000
01:03:05,000 --> and what is the covariant derivative 01:03:07,000
01:03:07,000 --> well the covariant derivative is going 01:03:10,000
01:03:10,000 --> to be the ordinary derivative the VM by 01:03:14,000
01:03:14,000 --> dy n which is what we thought it was but 01:03:18,000
01:03:18,000 --> it wasn't plus the Christoffel symbol 01:03:22,000
01:03:22,000 --> plus the correction term multiplied by 01:03:28,000
01:03:28,000 --> the arc ex and so we've now got a 01:03:37,000
01:03:37,000 --> transformation where you've got 01:03:38,000
01:03:38,000 --> derivatives which has to include this 01:03:42,000
01:03:42,000 --> Christoffel symbol it's the extra term 01:03:45,000
01:03:45,000 --> and I'm gonna call that equation 7 so 01:03:52,000
01:03:52,000 --> let's put a box around it 01:03:59,000
01:03:59,000 --> and now we can ask ourselves the 01:04:02,000
01:04:02,000 --> question so what is this Christoffel 01:04:05,000
01:04:05,000 --> symbol and it's the compensation for the 01:04:09,000
01:04:09,000 --> fact that the ordinary derivative of a 01:04:11,000
01:04:11,000 --> tensor in one frame of reference does 01:04:14,000
01:04:14,000 --> not transform you need the covariant 01:04:19,000
01:04:19,000 --> derivative in order that you can get a 01:04:21,000
01:04:21,000 --> transformation of a derivative of a 01:04:24,000
01:04:24,000 --> vector which is a part of a tensor and 01:04:27,000
01:04:27,000 --> that's important because a lot of the 01:04:30,000
01:04:30,000 --> Einstein field equations required 01:04:32,000
01:04:32,000 --> derivatives of tensors well we just did 01:04:36,000
01:04:36,000 --> that using vectors we're going to need 01:04:38,000
01:04:38,000 --> to expand that for the purposes of 01:04:40,000
01:04:40,000 --> tensors so let's take the covariant 01:04:44,000
01:04:44,000 --> derivative I'm going to have to use P 01:04:47,000
01:04:47,000 --> because I'm going to use M and in in a 01:04:48,000
01:04:48,000 --> moment because I'm going to do the 01:04:50,000
01:04:50,000 --> covariant derivative of the tensor T M 01:04:54,000
01:04:54,000 --> in and that is going to be if you look 01:04:58,000
01:04:58,000 --> at the equation that we just derived 01:05:00,000
01:05:00,000 --> which is equation number 7 showing 01:05:04,000
01:05:04,000 --> essentially if I double that up for two 01:05:07,000
01:05:07,000 --> indices I'm gonna get the ordinary 01:05:10,000
01:05:10,000 --> derivative t MN by T y PE you will see 01:05:16,000
01:05:16,000 --> how that derives from equation seven but 01:05:20,000
01:05:20,000 --> now I'm going to need to Christoffel 01:05:22,000
01:05:22,000 --> symbols so I'm going to need one for the 01:05:27,000
01:05:27,000 --> M element and one for the N element so 01:05:31,000
01:05:31,000 --> this is going to be plus another 01:05:37,000
01:05:37,000 --> Christoffel symbol for the M element and 01:05:47,000
01:05:47,000 --> that's the transformation of a tensor 01:05:51,000
01:05:51,000 --> from one frame of reference to another 01:05:54,000
01:05:54,000 --> and we'll call that equation number 01:05:58,000
01:05:58,000 --> eight 01:06:04,000
01:06:04,000 --> now what about the covariant derivative 01:06:07,000
01:06:07,000 --> of the metric tensor that we derived 01:06:09,000
01:06:09,000 --> earlier let's just remind ourselves what 01:06:13,000
01:06:13,000 --> the metric tensor was we started off 01:06:15,000
01:06:15,000 --> with good old Pythagoras 01:06:17,000
01:06:17,000 --> where this was the X 1 this is the X 2 01:06:21,000
01:06:21,000 --> this is DS and we say that the S squared 01:06:24,000
01:06:24,000 --> equals DX 1 squared plus DX 2 all 01:06:30,000
01:06:30,000 --> squared and we said that you could 01:06:33,000
01:06:33,000 --> rewrite that as the sum of DX n times DX 01:06:40,000
01:06:40,000 --> and or if you like you could write that 01:06:45,000
01:06:45,000 --> as the sum of DX m DX n times the 01:06:50,000
01:06:50,000 --> Kronecker Delta M n where remember the 01:06:53,000
01:06:53,000 --> Kronecker Delta was 1 when M equals n 01:06:58,000
01:06:58,000 --> and it was 0 when M does not equal n and 01:07:01,000
01:07:01,000 --> we said that on flat space that is 01:07:06,000
01:07:06,000 --> essentially G MN for flat space it's not 01:07:11,000
01:07:11,000 --> true for curved space indeed that's the 01:07:13,000
01:07:13,000 --> reason you have the metric tensor G MN 01:07:16,000
01:07:16,000 --> it corrects Pythagoras for curved space 01:07:19,000
01:07:19,000 --> now what is the derivative we'll call it 01:07:24,000
01:07:24,000 --> the covariant derivative of G MN let's 01:07:28,000
01:07:28,000 --> say with respect to R in the X frame of 01:07:33,000
01:07:33,000 --> reference if we are talking about flat 01:07:36,000
01:07:36,000 --> space well in flat space the metric 01:07:42,000
01:07:42,000 --> tensor is either 1 or it is 0 it is a 01:07:46,000
01:07:46,000 --> constant so the covariant derivative of 01:07:49,000
01:07:49,000 --> a constant in flat space is 0 but what 01:07:54,000
01:07:54,000 --> did I tell you about derivatives of 01:07:56,000
01:07:56,000 --> tensors if you've got a value of 0 in 01:08:01,000
01:08:01,000 --> one frame of reference then you've got a 01:08:04,000
01:08:04,000 --> value of 0 in all frames of reference so 01:08:07,000
01:08:07,000 --> consequently the derivative of the 01:08:10,000
01:08:10,000 --> metric tensor 01:08:12,000
01:08:12,000 --> well the covariant derivative of the 01:08:14,000
01:08:14,000 --> metric tensor will 01:08:15,000
01:08:15,000 --> zero in all frames of reference which 01:08:20,000
01:08:20,000 --> means if we take this formula up here 01:08:23,000
01:08:23,000 --> equation number eight and replace just 01:08:27,000
01:08:27,000 --> write it down again but put T sorry put 01:08:31,000
01:08:31,000 --> G in in place of all the t's we will 01:08:34,000
01:08:34,000 --> have a transformation and or a value of 01:08:39,000
01:08:39,000 --> the covariant derivative of G in terms 01:08:42,000
01:08:42,000 --> of all these terms but the covariant of 01:08:45,000
01:08:45,000 --> G of course always equals zero so if we 01:08:49,000
01:08:49,000 --> replace T's by G's then this all becomes 01:08:53,000
01:08:53,000 --> zero so let's just do it I'm going to 01:08:55,000
01:08:55,000 --> take equation number eight and I'm 01:08:57,000
01:08:57,000 --> simply going to write it out again 01:08:59,000
01:08:59,000 --> exactly as it was but this time I'm 01:09:02,000
01:09:02,000 --> going to substitute G for all the t's so 01:09:06,000
01:09:06,000 --> I'm going to get DG m n by d YP plus the 01:09:13,000
01:09:13,000 --> Christoffel symbol p.m. and R of G are n 01:09:19,000
01:09:19,000 --> plus the Christoffel symbol P n R of G M 01:09:26,000
01:09:26,000 --> R and well I can now tell you is that 01:09:30,000
01:09:30,000 --> that the covariant derivative equals 01:09:33,000
01:09:33,000 --> zero so I can put that as zero and now 01:09:37,000
01:09:37,000 --> I've got an equation which has got the 01:09:41,000
01:09:41,000 --> metric tensor in it and a derivative of 01:09:45,000
01:09:45,000 --> the metric tensor and the Christoffel 01:09:48,000
01:09:48,000 --> symbol so I ought to be able to 01:09:50,000
01:09:50,000 --> rearrange that equation so that I can 01:09:53,000
01:09:53,000 --> express the Christoffel symbol in terms 01:09:56,000
01:09:56,000 --> of the metric tensor now for that you 01:09:59,000
01:09:59,000 --> need a mathematician so you go along to 01:10:01,000
01:10:01,000 --> your friendly mathematical professor and 01:10:03,000
01:10:03,000 --> I daresay Einstein did the same and he 01:10:06,000
01:10:06,000 --> will tell you that if you've got a 01:10:09,000
01:10:09,000 --> Christoffel symbol with just a B and C 01:10:13,000
01:10:13,000 --> then that is going to be equal to take a 01:10:17,000
01:10:17,000 --> deep breath 1/2 G a de where D is an 01:10:24,000
01:10:24,000 --> additional term it becomes an additional 01:10:25,000
01:10:25,000 --> summation term 01:10:28,000
01:10:28,000 --> to the derivative of G DC / DX B or by 01:10:36,000
01:10:36,000 --> DX B + remember the mathematicians come 01:10:39,000
01:10:39,000 --> up with this so we naturally take their 01:10:42,000
01:10:42,000 --> word for it - I hope this is going to 01:10:47,000
01:10:47,000 --> fit in 01:10:47,000
01:10:47,000 --> d G BC by DX D and I'll call that 01:10:58,000
01:10:58,000 --> equation 9 and what you've got courtesy 01:11:04,000
01:11:04,000 --> of the mathematicians is you've taken 01:11:06,000
01:11:06,000 --> this term which we ourselves managed to 01:11:11,000
01:11:11,000 --> derive you've jiggled in about so that 01:11:14,000
01:11:14,000 --> you've got because it equals zero 01:11:16,000
01:11:16,000 --> you've got the gamma terms the 01:11:18,000
01:11:18,000 --> Christoffel terms expressed in terms of 01:11:21,000
01:11:21,000 --> the metric tensor and first derivatives 01:11:24,000
01:11:24,000 --> of the metric tensor so what can you say 01:11:29,000
01:11:29,000 --> about this Christoffel symbol firstly 01:11:32,000
01:11:32,000 --> it's not itself a tensor it's in the 01:11:35,000
01:11:35,000 --> sense it's a correction term Christoffel 01:11:38,000
01:11:38,000 --> symbol will be equal to zero in flat 01:11:41,000
01:11:41,000 --> space but it won't be equal to zero in 01:11:46,000
01:11:46,000 --> curvilinear time space or space time and 01:11:50,000
01:11:50,000 --> you'll also notice that it can be 01:11:52,000
01:11:52,000 --> expressed wholly in terms of the metric 01:11:55,000
01:11:55,000 --> tensor and the first derivatives of big 01:11:58,000
01:11:58,000 --> metric tensor and you might ask yourself 01:12:01,000
01:12:01,000 --> why have we spent all this time trying 01:12:05,000
01:12:05,000 --> to find a thing called a Christoffel 01:12:07,000
01:12:07,000 --> symbol when it doesn't even feature in 01:12:11,000
01:12:11,000 --> the einstein field equations you will 01:12:13,000
01:12:13,000 --> not see a Christoffel symbol in that 01:12:15,000
01:12:15,000 --> equation in those equations the answer's 01:12:19,000
01:12:19,000 --> no you won't but that's because the 01:12:21,000
01:12:21,000 --> Christoffel symbol is buried in the 01:12:23,000
01:12:23,000 --> Ricci curvature tensor and that's what 01:12:26,000
01:12:26,000 --> we're going on to next but first I think 01:12:29,000
01:12:29,000 --> it's possibly time for another break ok 01:12:34,000
01:12:34,000 --> so now we come on to curvature if we're 01:12:37,000
01:12:37,000 --> going to talk about curved space time 01:12:39,000
01:12:39,000 --> we've ever 01:12:40,000
01:12:40,000 --> understand what curvature means let us 01:12:43,000
01:12:43,000 --> take a path in flat space flat space 01:12:47,000
01:12:47,000 --> fell flat space-time my paper is flat 01:12:51,000
01:12:51,000 --> what you do is you take a vector a 01:12:54,000
01:12:54,000 --> vector of course will have magnitude and 01:12:58,000
01:12:58,000 --> direction and what you do is you what's 01:13:01,000
01:13:01,000 --> called parallel transport it around the 01:13:04,000
01:13:04,000 --> path that means you keep the same length 01:13:08,000
01:13:08,000 --> of vector and you keep it oriented in 01:13:11,000
01:13:11,000 --> the same way so it travels parallel to 01:13:13,000
01:13:13,000 --> itself so all of those lines are 01:13:16,000
01:13:16,000 --> intended to be my drawing may not make 01:13:19,000
01:13:19,000 --> it quite so obvious but they are 01:13:21,000
01:13:21,000 --> intended to be the same length and all 01:13:24,000
01:13:24,000 --> of the vectors are parallel so they just 01:13:28,000
01:13:28,000 --> keep parallel for themselves until you 01:13:31,000
01:13:31,000 --> get back to where you started and of 01:13:33,000
01:13:33,000 --> course when you get back to where you 01:13:35,000
01:13:35,000 --> started your vector will be of the same 01:13:37,000
01:13:37,000 --> length and it will be in the same 01:13:39,000
01:13:39,000 --> direction because it's always moved 01:13:43,000
01:13:43,000 --> parallel to itself so it will come back 01:13:45,000
01:13:45,000 --> to where it started okay all very well 01:13:49,000
01:13:49,000 --> and good but now let's take a code here 01:13:57,000
01:13:57,000 --> is a cone which I have made for 01:13:59,000
01:13:59,000 --> illustration purposes as you can see 01:14:03,000
01:14:03,000 --> it's curved cone but I can do is I can 01:14:07,000
01:14:07,000 --> cut down the side of the cone and open 01:14:11,000
01:14:11,000 --> it up so if I make a cut along one line 01:14:14,000
01:14:14,000 --> I can then open the cone up and if he 01:14:17,000
01:14:17,000 --> comes flat and it has that kind of shape 01:14:21,000
01:14:21,000 --> so let me recreate the cone I just bring 01:14:24,000
01:14:24,000 --> those two lines together when it's a 01:14:27,000
01:14:27,000 --> cone that edge is joined up so in a 01:14:32,000
01:14:32,000 --> sense this edge here and this edge here 01:14:35,000
01:14:35,000 --> are the same line the same point on the 01:14:39,000
01:14:39,000 --> cone so let's just draw what the code 01:14:44,000
01:14:44,000 --> looks like when you open it up you cut 01:14:47,000
01:14:47,000 --> down this point here and you open it up 01:14:53,000
01:14:53,000 --> and you get a shape that looks like it's 01:14:57,000
01:14:57,000 --> a circle but with a slice taken out of 01:15:01,000
01:15:01,000 --> it that's the cone just a quick reminder 01:15:03,000
01:15:03,000 --> there is the cone and remember that the 01:15:07,000
01:15:07,000 --> line o ay and the line OB when they are 01:15:12,000
01:15:12,000 --> in a cone are the same line it's that 01:15:15,000
01:15:15,000 --> dotted line now I'm going to do a bit of 01:15:19,000
01:15:19,000 --> parallel transporting and to remember 01:15:22,000
01:15:22,000 --> where the vector was let me just take 01:15:24,000
01:15:24,000 --> that V out of the way and put it there 01:15:26,000
01:15:26,000 --> a B I'm going to have a vector which 01:15:31,000
01:15:31,000 --> continues the line OB so just a straight 01:15:35,000
01:15:35,000 --> continuation and now I'm going to 01:15:38,000
01:15:38,000 --> parallel transport that vector around 01:15:41,000
01:15:41,000 --> the cone remember it stays the same 01:15:47,000
01:15:47,000 --> length though mine may not it always 01:15:49,000
01:15:49,000 --> stays parallel and we keep going until 01:15:52,000
01:15:52,000 --> we get to a and we stop because a is 01:16:00,000
01:16:00,000 --> point B remember they are the same 01:16:03,000
01:16:03,000 --> points on the cone but what has happened 01:16:06,000
01:16:06,000 --> well the length of the vector is the 01:16:09,000
01:16:09,000 --> same but the direction of the vector has 01:16:13,000
01:16:13,000 --> changed 01:16:14,000
01:16:14,000 --> you can tell it's changed direction 01:16:16,000
01:16:16,000 --> because I started it as being an 01:16:18,000
01:16:18,000 --> extension of the line OB and OB is the 01:16:22,000
01:16:22,000 --> same as the line o a remember it's this 01:16:24,000
01:16:24,000 --> dotted line here so if the vector were 01:16:28,000
01:16:28,000 --> to be in the same direction it should 01:16:31,000
01:16:31,000 --> end up like that but it didn't he ended 01:16:35,000
01:16:35,000 --> up like this it's gone through an angle 01:16:38,000
01:16:38,000 --> so although the length has remained the 01:16:41,000
01:16:41,000 --> same the direction of the vector has 01:16:44,000
01:16:44,000 --> changed and that is a measure of 01:16:47,000
01:16:47,000 --> curvature if you parallel transport a 01:16:50,000
01:16:50,000 --> vector around a surface and you don't 01:16:54,000
01:16:54,000 --> get back and you get back to the same 01:16:56,000
01:16:56,000 --> position remember position a is position 01:16:59,000
01:16:59,000 --> B you get back to the same point but the 01:17:02,000
01:17:02,000 --> vector has changed direction then you've 01:17:05,000
01:17:05,000 --> gone round occur 01:17:06,000
01:17:06,000 --> so that's how we're going to define 01:17:08,000
01:17:08,000 --> curvature an angle change in the vector 01:17:11,000
01:17:11,000 --> when you parallel transport it 01:17:14,000
01:17:14,000 --> transported around a surface if it's a 01:17:17,000
01:17:17,000 --> flat surface as we showed no change in 01:17:20,000
01:17:20,000 --> direction if there's a curved surface it 01:17:23,000
01:17:23,000 --> changes direction now I'm just going to 01:17:25,000
01:17:25,000 --> take a slight diversion and a pause to 01:17:28,000
01:17:28,000 --> deal with two definitions the first is 01:17:32,000
01:17:32,000 --> what's called a commutator commutator 01:17:36,000
01:17:36,000 --> czar written like this square brackets a 01:17:38,000
01:17:38,000 --> and B and all that means is a B minus B 01:17:44,000
01:17:44,000 --> a a times B minus B times a now of 01:17:48,000
01:17:48,000 --> course if we are simply talking about 01:17:50,000
01:17:50,000 --> pure numbers then that will equal 0 3 01:17:54,000
01:17:54,000 --> times 2 minus 2 times 3 is 0 the point 01:17:59,000
01:17:59,000 --> about commutator is they don't always 01:18:01,000
01:18:01,000 --> equal 0 and I'm particularly going to 01:18:05,000
01:18:05,000 --> look at one which is the commutator of D 01:18:09,000
01:18:09,000 --> by DX and some function of X that's my 01:18:14,000
01:18:14,000 --> commutator and I'm going to show that 01:18:18,000
01:18:18,000 --> that actually equals D FX divided by DX 01:18:23,000
01:18:23,000 --> it doesn't equal 0 so let's just do a 01:18:27,000
01:18:27,000 --> quick proof remember that the commutator 01:18:30,000
01:18:30,000 --> is a B minus B a so it's going to be 01:18:34,000
01:18:34,000 --> that times that minus that times that so 01:18:39,000
01:18:39,000 --> let's just write that out that's going 01:18:41,000
01:18:41,000 --> to be d by DX of F X minus FX times D by 01:18:52,000
01:18:52,000 --> DX now you've got to apply a D by DX to 01:18:56,000
01:18:56,000 --> something so let's just call it V but 01:19:03,000
01:19:03,000 --> here we've got the differentiation of a 01:19:06,000
01:19:06,000 --> product and just as we did before we can 01:19:08,000
01:19:08,000 --> say that D a B is equal to BD a plus a 01:19:15,000
01:19:15,000 --> DB doesn't matter which way around you 01:19:18,000
01:19:18,000 --> do it 01:19:19,000
01:19:19,000 --> differential of a product BD a plus a DB 01:19:23,000
01:19:23,000 --> where this is a and this is B so 01:19:26,000
01:19:26,000 --> consequently this term here using this 01:19:30,000
01:19:30,000 --> formula here will equal B which is V 01:19:33,000
01:19:33,000 --> times da which is D FX by the X plus a 01:19:44,000
01:19:44,000 --> which is FX times DB DV v DX that is 01:19:54,000
01:19:54,000 --> that term and we must remember that term 01:19:56,000
01:19:56,000 --> there which is minus FX DV by DX and 01:20:01,000
01:20:01,000 --> you'll see that that term and that term 01:20:04,000
01:20:04,000 --> are equal so one minus the other is zero 01:20:08,000
01:20:08,000 --> and you're left with V times DF x times 01:20:11,000
01:20:11,000 --> DX well V is something we simply 01:20:13,000
01:20:13,000 --> inserted so we can now take that out and 01:20:16,000
01:20:16,000 --> now you've got that the commutator is 01:20:20,000
01:20:20,000 --> equal to DF X by DX which is what we 01:20:23,000
01:20:23,000 --> wanted to show in the first place so 01:20:25,000
01:20:25,000 --> let's now take two coordinates which do 01:20:30,000
01:20:30,000 --> not necessarily have to be right angles 01:20:32,000
01:20:32,000 --> this is the X mu of coordinate this is 01:20:36,000
01:20:36,000 --> the X new coordinate and I'm going to 01:20:40,000
01:20:40,000 --> have a distance which I'm going to call 01:20:42,000
01:20:42,000 --> DX mu and I'm gonna have a distance this 01:20:46,000
01:20:46,000 --> way which is DX new so a distance DX mu 01:20:50,000
01:20:50,000 --> in the X view coordinate system and a 01:20:53,000
01:20:53,000 --> distance DX new in the X new Co ordinate 01:20:57,000
01:20:57,000 --> what I'm going to do is construct a 01:20:59,000
01:20:59,000 --> parallelogram from that so essentially 01:21:02,000
01:21:02,000 --> it's going to be a parallelogram where 01:21:06,000
01:21:06,000 --> the length of these two are going to be 01:21:10,000
01:21:10,000 --> DX mu and that's the same there and the 01:21:16,000
01:21:16,000 --> length of these two sides D X new so far 01:21:23,000
01:21:23,000 --> so good and now I'm going to do a 01:21:26,000
01:21:26,000 --> parallel transport around this path 01:21:30,000
01:21:30,000 --> we're going to go from a 01:21:33,000
01:21:33,000 --> to B to C to D and back to a again but 01:21:37,000
01:21:37,000 --> I'm going to call the return point 01:21:39,000
01:21:39,000 --> a-prime because I'm not sure that we're 01:21:43,000
01:21:43,000 --> going to get back the victor will be 01:21:44,000
01:21:44,000 --> exactly the same when it gets to a prime 01:21:46,000
01:21:46,000 --> so the vector at a prime may not be the 01:21:49,000
01:21:49,000 --> same as the vector at a if we have gone 01:21:52,000
01:21:52,000 --> round a curved surface now let's just 01:21:56,000
01:21:56,000 --> take two paths consider two parts the 01:21:59,000
01:21:59,000 --> first is VC minus VD that's the 01:22:05,000
01:22:05,000 --> essentially what we're talking about 01:22:06,000
01:22:06,000 --> there is the difference between the 01:22:08,000
01:22:08,000 --> vector at Point C and the vector at 01:22:11,000
01:22:11,000 --> Point D and compare that with the vector 01:22:16,000
01:22:16,000 --> at point B and the vector at Point a now 01:22:24,000
01:22:24,000 --> if we are going around a flat surface 01:22:28,000
01:22:28,000 --> then the C minus PD will equal VB minus 01:22:34,000
01:22:34,000 --> VA and that whole term will equal zero 01:22:38,000
01:22:38,000 --> but what this is actually representing 01:22:40,000
01:22:40,000 --> is the differences in the D mu direction 01:22:45,000
01:22:45,000 --> because it's that's the or the DX mu 01:22:48,000
01:22:48,000 --> direction because that's the directions 01:22:52,000
01:22:52,000 --> that we're moving here similarly if you 01:22:57,000
01:22:57,000 --> take the C minus V B which is this path 01:23:03,000
01:23:03,000 --> here minus VD minus VA prime you get the 01:23:11,000
01:23:11,000 --> difference in the DX new direction 01:23:18,000
01:23:18,000 --> because that's that path there and that 01:23:20,000
01:23:20,000 --> path there they're parallel in flat 01:23:23,000
01:23:23,000 --> space there would be no difference but 01:23:25,000
01:23:25,000 --> in curved space there might be and 01:23:27,000
01:23:27,000 --> you're now looking at the difference in 01:23:29,000
01:23:29,000 --> the D new direction now let's have a 01:23:32,000
01:23:32,000 --> look at the difference of the 01:23:34,000
01:23:34,000 --> differences if we take this term here 01:23:37,000
01:23:37,000 --> and we subtract from it this term here 01:23:44,000
01:23:44,000 --> what do we get 01:23:46,000
01:23:46,000 --> well let's have a look at the VB term 01:23:49,000
01:23:49,000 --> we've got a minus VB and the minus minus 01:23:53,000
01:23:53,000 --> VB that becomes plus so we get a minus 01:23:56,000
01:23:56,000 --> plus zero we get no resultant VB term 01:24:00,000
01:24:00,000 --> then took an pc we've got a plus VC 01:24:04,000
01:24:04,000 --> minus VC the VC term goes BD we've got a 01:24:09,000
01:24:09,000 --> minus VD minus a minus VD so it's plus 01:24:13,000
01:24:13,000 --> minus plus the VD term goes as well what 01:24:18,000
01:24:18,000 --> about VA we've got a minus minus so that 01:24:22,000
01:24:22,000 --> becomes a plus so we've got VA and then 01:24:26,000
01:24:26,000 --> we've got for VA prime we've got a minus 01:24:29,000
01:24:29,000 --> minus minus so three minuses make a 01:24:32,000
01:24:32,000 --> minor so that becomes minus V a prime 01:24:35,000
01:24:35,000 --> and that's the difference of differences 01:24:39,000
01:24:39,000 --> that's going to be the change in the 01:24:41,000
01:24:41,000 --> vector as it is parallel transported 01:24:44,000
01:24:44,000 --> around that parallelogram as I say in 01:24:48,000
01:24:48,000 --> flat space no problem DV will be zero 01:24:51,000
01:24:51,000 --> because there won't be any change it 01:24:52,000
01:24:52,000 --> will just parallel transport round it 01:24:55,000
01:24:55,000 --> will come back to the same magnitude and 01:24:57,000
01:24:57,000 --> the same direction but it is in curved 01:24:59,000
01:24:59,000 --> space there will be a difference not in 01:25:03,000
01:25:03,000 --> length but in angle of the vector now 01:25:07,000
01:25:07,000 --> let's take this first term here VC minus 01:25:09,000
01:25:09,000 --> VD what actually is that well that is 01:25:12,000
01:25:12,000 --> the change as the vector goes from C to 01:25:16,000
01:25:16,000 --> D along a distance DX mu so VC minus VD 01:25:24,000
01:25:24,000 --> is simply the change in the vector along 01:25:31,000
01:25:31,000 --> the distance X mu multi multiplied by 01:25:38,000
01:25:38,000 --> the distance you travel which of course 01:25:40,000
01:25:40,000 --> is DX mu multiplied of course by the 01:25:42,000
01:25:42,000 --> vector itself so what we're saying is 01:25:45,000
01:25:45,000 --> that the change in the vector between C 01:25:48,000
01:25:48,000 --> and D is the gradient remember we did 01:25:53,000
01:25:53,000 --> this right at the beginning with our 01:25:54,000
01:25:54,000 --> field the gradient multiplied by the 01:25:58,000
01:25:58,000 --> distance times of course the 01:26:00,000
01:26:00,000 --> value of the vector but we've just 01:26:03,000
01:26:03,000 --> learned that we need to be very careful 01:26:04,000
01:26:04,000 --> about ordinary derivatives when you're 01:26:07,000
01:26:07,000 --> talking about curves you need to use the 01:26:10,000
01:26:10,000 --> covariant derivative so actually to be 01:26:13,000
01:26:13,000 --> more accurate we better call this the 01:26:15,000
01:26:15,000 --> covariant derivative so instead of using 01:26:17,000
01:26:17,000 --> this gradient we're going to use the 01:26:20,000
01:26:20,000 --> covariant derivative times DX mu that's 01:26:23,000
01:26:23,000 --> this term here times the value of the 01:26:25,000
01:26:25,000 --> vector that's a much healthier way of 01:26:28,000
01:26:28,000 --> doing it because we've just learned that 01:26:30,000
01:26:30,000 --> you have to be very careful about 01:26:31,000
01:26:31,000 --> ordinary derivatives when you're 01:26:33,000
01:26:33,000 --> transforming between different reference 01:26:35,000
01:26:35,000 --> systems now what is this term 01:26:38,000
01:26:38,000 --> BC - VD minus VB minus VA that is the 01:26:43,000
01:26:43,000 --> difference in the differences on on a 01:26:49,000
01:26:49,000 --> line which is separated by the distance 01:26:52,000
01:26:52,000 --> DX nu so essentially what you're doing 01:26:56,000
01:26:56,000 --> is you're looking at the difference of 01:26:57,000
01:26:57,000 --> vectors with a separation of DX nu which 01:27:01,000
01:27:01,000 --> means you have to apply a new gradient 01:27:04,000
01:27:04,000 --> to it so VC minus VD minus VB minus VA 01:27:11,000
01:27:11,000 --> which is this term here which is as I 01:27:15,000
01:27:15,000 --> said the difference in the vectors in 01:27:18,000
01:27:18,000 --> those two lines separated by different 01:27:21,000
01:27:21,000 --> distance DX nu well we said that VC 01:27:26,000
01:27:26,000 --> minus VD is the covariant derivative 01:27:32,000
01:27:32,000 --> times the distance times all that sorry 01:27:34,000
01:27:34,000 --> not knew that V times the value of the 01:27:36,000
01:27:36,000 --> vector but the difference is essentially 01:27:40,000
01:27:40,000 --> another differential and it's the 01:27:42,000
01:27:42,000 --> differential in the new direction so 01:27:45,000
01:27:45,000 --> we've now got to add covariant 01:27:49,000
01:27:49,000 --> derivative in the new direction times 01:27:51,000
01:27:51,000 --> the distance away so that is effectively 01:27:55,000
01:27:55,000 --> what that difference that difference 01:28:00,000
01:28:00,000 --> equals what about this one here 01:28:04,000
01:28:04,000 --> well this one will just be the opposite 01:28:08,000
01:28:08,000 --> in other words VC minus VB minus V 01:28:14,000
01:28:14,000 --> - VA prime is just gonna be well VC 01:28:19,000
01:28:19,000 --> minus VB will be the covariant 01:28:23,000
01:28:23,000 --> derivative but this time in the new 01:28:24,000
01:28:24,000 --> direction so now we need covariant 01:28:28,000
01:28:28,000 --> direction in the new direction times DX 01:28:30,000
01:28:30,000 --> nu times the value of the vector but 01:28:34,000
01:28:34,000 --> this subtraction means that you're 01:28:36,000
01:28:36,000 --> looking at the difference between this 01:28:39,000
01:28:39,000 --> line and this line separated by DX mu so 01:28:43,000
01:28:43,000 --> you're essentially applying another 01:28:45,000
01:28:45,000 --> differential but this time in that mu 01:28:47,000
01:28:47,000 --> direction so we've now got that that 01:28:52,000
01:28:52,000 --> term is essentially that term and this 01:28:56,000
01:28:56,000 --> term is essentially this term and what 01:28:59,000
01:28:59,000 --> we said was that if you subtract that or 01:29:03,000
01:29:03,000 --> if you subtract that term from that term 01:29:05,000
01:29:05,000 --> you get VA minus V prime a prime which 01:29:08,000
01:29:08,000 --> is the difference in the vector the 01:29:12,000
01:29:12,000 --> difference between the vector at the 01:29:13,000
01:29:13,000 --> starting point and the vector at the end 01:29:15,000
01:29:15,000 --> point so if you subtract this term from 01:29:20,000
01:29:20,000 --> this term you're going to get DV the 01:29:24,000
01:29:24,000 --> difference in the vectors so let's write 01:29:27,000
01:29:27,000 --> it out DV is going to be equal to that 01:29:32,000
01:29:32,000 --> term minus that term which is gamma nu 01:29:38,000
01:29:38,000 --> sorry a very derivative new covariant 01:29:41,000
01:29:41,000 --> derivative mu doesn't matter which order 01:29:44,000
01:29:44,000 --> we put these in DX nu DX mu V minus this 01:29:51,000
01:29:51,000 --> term covariant derivative mu covariant 01:29:55,000
01:29:55,000 --> derivative nu DX mu DX nu V and we can 01:30:02,000
01:30:02,000 --> pull out the DX nu DX mu and V because 01:30:05,000
01:30:05,000 --> author again doesn't matter here so that 01:30:08,000
01:30:08,000 --> becomes DX mu DX nu V into what's left 01:30:16,000
01:30:16,000 --> which is covariant new covariant mu 01:30:21,000
01:30:21,000 --> minus covariant mu covariant nu 01:30:25,000
01:30:25,000 --> and that you'll recognize of course is 01:30:28,000
01:30:28,000 --> simply the definition of commutator 01:30:35,000
01:30:35,000 --> which is of course simply Delta Nu comma 01:30:38,000
01:30:38,000 --> Delta mu not Delta's covariant 01:30:43,000
01:30:43,000 --> derivatives off but you'll remember that 01:30:46,000
01:30:46,000 --> from Equation seven the covariant 01:30:51,000
01:30:51,000 --> derivative is equal to the ordinary 01:30:55,000
01:30:55,000 --> derivative incidentally when I write D 01:30:57,000
01:30:57,000 --> nu like that what I really mean is D by 01:31:00,000
01:31:00,000 --> the X nu it's just a shorthand plus a 01:31:04,000
01:31:04,000 --> gamma term I won't write out the full 01:31:06,000
01:31:06,000 --> details of it but there was a gamma term 01:31:08,000
01:31:08,000 --> remember that was the correcting term 01:31:11,000
01:31:11,000 --> the Christoffel symbol term so wherever 01:31:15,000
01:31:15,000 --> we have this covariant form 01:31:18,000
01:31:18,000 --> we'll remember from Equation 7 that the 01:31:21,000
01:31:21,000 --> covariant form is the ordinary 01:31:23,000
01:31:23,000 --> derivative plus this correcting term 01:31:25,000
01:31:25,000 --> which involves the Christoffel symbol so 01:31:29,000
01:31:29,000 --> on that basis the commutator of which we 01:31:35,000
01:31:35,000 --> identified before is going to be equal 01:31:39,000
01:31:39,000 --> that times that minus that times that 01:31:43,000
01:31:43,000 --> that's what a commutator is but remember 01:31:46,000
01:31:46,000 --> that the covariant derivative is the 01:31:49,000
01:31:49,000 --> ordinary derivative times the assorting 01:31:51,000
01:31:51,000 --> plus the Christoffel term so we now get 01:31:55,000
01:31:55,000 --> that that is equivalent to this term is 01:32:01,000
01:32:01,000 --> d nu plus a Christoffel symbol 01:32:04,000
01:32:04,000 --> associated with nu times this term which 01:32:08,000
01:32:08,000 --> is the d mu plus the Christoffel symbol 01:32:11,000
01:32:11,000 --> associated with mu minus this term times 01:32:20,000
01:32:20,000 --> this term 01:32:25,000
01:32:25,000 --> I hope you can see that and let's just 01:32:34,000
01:32:34,000 --> multiply that all out so we've got a D 01:32:37,000
01:32:37,000 --> nu times D mu term then we've got a 01:32:44,000
01:32:44,000 --> gamma nu times D mu then we've got a 01:32:53,000
01:32:53,000 --> Dinu times gamma mu and finally we've 01:33:00,000
01:33:00,000 --> got a gamma nu gamma mu and that's that 01:33:07,000
01:33:07,000 --> all multiplied out from that we have to 01:33:11,000
01:33:11,000 --> subtract this term 01:33:16,000
01:33:16,000 --> well let's multiply that out we've got a 01:33:17,000
01:33:17,000 --> d mu times d nu those should be curly DS 01:33:23,000
01:33:23,000 --> by the way all of these should be curly 01:33:25,000
01:33:25,000 --> DS plus we've got a D mu gamma nu term 01:33:37,000
01:33:37,000 --> then we've got a gamma mu D nu term 01:33:42,000
01:33:42,000 --> and finally we've got a gamma mu gamma 01:33:47,000
01:33:47,000 --> nu term right let's do the subtractions 01:33:52,000
01:33:52,000 --> D nu D mu minus D mu D nu is equal to 0 01:33:58,000
01:33:58,000 --> because for ordinary derivatives the 01:34:01,000
01:34:01,000 --> order doesn't matter gamma nu D mu minus 01:34:06,000
01:34:06,000 --> D mu gamma nu will let a commutator in 01:34:10,000
01:34:10,000 --> fact that is equal to the minus the 01:34:12,000
01:34:12,000 --> commutator of D mu gamma nu gamma nu D 01:34:18,000
01:34:18,000 --> nu is equal to minus the commutator of D 01:34:21,000
01:34:21,000 --> nu gamma nu we've got another commutator 01:34:26,000
01:34:26,000 --> here D nu gamma mu minus gamma nu D nu 01:34:30,000
01:34:30,000 --> well that's just the commutator of D nu 01:34:34,000
01:34:34,000 --> gamma mu 01:34:37,000
01:34:37,000 --> then we've got gamma nu gamma mu minus 01:34:42,000
01:34:42,000 --> gamma mu gamma nu and that again is 01:34:46,000
01:34:46,000 --> going to be the commutator of whoops the 01:34:49,000
01:34:49,000 --> commutator of gamma nu gamma mu so just 01:34:56,000
01:34:56,000 --> remind you that was the commutator of 01:34:59,000
01:34:59,000 --> the two covariant vectors here or two 01:35:02,000
01:35:02,000 --> covariant terms here becomes this term 01:35:06,000
01:35:06,000 --> here but you may remember when I took 01:35:10,000
01:35:10,000 --> that diversion to talk about commutator 01:35:13,000
01:35:13,000 --> z' I said that if you have a function 01:35:15,000
01:35:15,000 --> like that that equals the derivative of 01:35:20,000
01:35:20,000 --> the gamma term with respect to X mu and 01:35:27,000
01:35:27,000 --> this becomes the derivative of the gamma 01:35:30,000
01:35:30,000 --> term with respect to X nu and this 01:35:37,000
01:35:37,000 --> entire term is called the Riemann tensor 01:35:46,000
01:35:46,000 --> and you'll notice that it is made up of 01:35:51,000
01:35:51,000 --> Christoffel symbols and derivatives of 01:35:55,000
01:35:55,000 --> Christoffel symbols it's called the 01:35:58,000
01:35:58,000 --> Riemann tensor I can tell you that for 01:36:02,000
01:36:02,000 --> our purposes it is also and can be 01:36:06,000
01:36:06,000 --> regarded as the Ricci tensor which we 01:36:10,000
01:36:10,000 --> need and that's why we needed to derive 01:36:12,000
01:36:12,000 --> the Christoffel symbols because as you 01:36:14,000
01:36:14,000 --> can see the Ricci tensor contains 01:36:17,000
01:36:17,000 --> Christoffel symbols and derivatives of 01:36:20,000
01:36:20,000 --> Christoffel symbols and the Ricci tensor 01:36:23,000
01:36:23,000 --> remember was the first term in the 01:36:26,000
01:36:26,000 --> Einstein field equations which I'm 01:36:28,000
01:36:28,000 --> showing you now just to remind you so 01:36:32,000
01:36:32,000 --> what we've just shown is that the change 01:36:34,000
01:36:34,000 --> in the vector remember the angle of 01:36:36,000
01:36:36,000 --> vector rather than the length is equal 01:36:38,000
01:36:38,000 --> to DX mu DX nu times V times the 01:36:44,000
01:36:44,000 --> commutator covariant nu 01:36:49,000
01:36:49,000 --> covariant Moo and that term we said was 01:36:55,000
01:36:55,000 --> the Riemann tensor but for our purposes 01:36:58,000
01:36:58,000 --> it's also the Ricci tensor so let's just 01:37:04,000
01:37:04,000 --> take stock of where we've got to we've 01:37:06,000
01:37:06,000 --> just shown that the Ricci tensor is made 01:37:09,000
01:37:09,000 --> up of Christoffel symbols and the 01:37:12,000
01:37:12,000 --> derivatives of Christoffel symbols but 01:37:16,000
01:37:16,000 --> what our Christoffel symbols will go 01:37:19,000
01:37:19,000 --> back to equation 9 and you see that 01:37:22,000
01:37:22,000 --> Christoffel symbols are made up of 01:37:24,000
01:37:24,000 --> metric tensors and the derivatives of 01:37:28,000
01:37:28,000 --> metric tensors and what are metric 01:37:32,000
01:37:32,000 --> tensors they can be thought of as the 01:37:35,000
01:37:35,000 --> device that you need to correct for 01:37:39,000
01:37:39,000 --> Pythagoras on a curved surface now what 01:37:43,000
01:37:43,000 --> I can also tell you is that from the 01:37:45,000
01:37:45,000 --> Ricci tensor arm you knew you can derive 01:37:49,000
01:37:49,000 --> what is called a curvature scalar it is 01:37:53,000
01:37:53,000 --> simply a scalar it is not a tensor not a 01:37:55,000
01:37:55,000 --> vector at just a scalar just as for 01:37:58,000
01:37:58,000 --> example if you take the dot product of 01:38:00,000
01:38:00,000 --> two vectors you get the scalar you can 01:38:03,000
01:38:03,000 --> take the Ricci tensor and from it you 01:38:07,000
01:38:07,000 --> can create a curvature scalar the point 01:38:09,000
01:38:09,000 --> about that is if the curvature scalar is 01:38:12,000
01:38:12,000 --> not zero then the surface is not flat 01:38:17,000
01:38:17,000 --> okay let's just review where we've got 01:38:19,000
01:38:19,000 --> to we've covered the metric tensor G mu 01:38:22,000
01:38:22,000 --> nu we've covered the Ricci tensor R mu 01:38:25,000
01:38:25,000 --> nu which includes a lot of Christoffel 01:38:27,000
01:38:27,000 --> symbols we've covered the curvature 01:38:30,000
01:38:30,000 --> scalar R and so we've covered most of 01:38:36,000
01:38:36,000 --> mine Stein's 01:38:37,000
01:38:37,000 --> field equations there are just two more 01:38:40,000
01:38:40,000 --> terms to go the stress energy momentum 01:38:43,000
01:38:43,000 --> tensor T mu nu and the cosmological 01:38:46,000
01:38:46,000 --> constant capital lambda but first time 01:38:51,000
01:38:51,000 --> for another break okay we're now ready 01:38:54,000
01:38:54,000 --> to do the stress energy momentum tensor 01:38:56,000
01:38:56,000 --> T mu nu what is the shortest distance 01:39:00,000
01:39:00,000 --> between two 01:39:03,000
01:39:03,000 --> answer a straight line what is the 01:39:07,000
01:39:07,000 --> shortest distance between two points say 01:39:10,000
01:39:10,000 --> on the surface of a sphere not two 01:39:14,000
01:39:14,000 --> points on a circle but two points on the 01:39:16,000
01:39:16,000 --> surface of a sphere the answer is the 01:39:19,000
01:39:19,000 --> shortest distance is what is called a 01:39:21,000
01:39:21,000 --> geodesic and on a sphere on the earth 01:39:26,000
01:39:26,000 --> for example the equator is a geodesic 01:39:28,000
01:39:28,000 --> any line of longitude is a geodesic the 01:39:33,000
01:39:33,000 --> shortest distance between two points 01:39:35,000
01:39:35,000 --> where you have to go round the curve you 01:39:38,000
01:39:38,000 --> can't go in a straight line is called a 01:39:40,000
01:39:40,000 --> geodesic and we can define what's called 01:39:43,000
01:39:43,000 --> a tangent vector DX mu by D tau as a 01:39:51,000
01:39:51,000 --> rate of change of the distance that we 01:39:55,000
01:39:55,000 --> travel with respect to time I'm using 01:39:57,000
01:39:57,000 --> tau because tau is what's called proper 01:40:00,000
01:40:00,000 --> time you can find out what proper time 01:40:02,000
01:40:02,000 --> is from my videos on special relativity 01:40:05,000
01:40:05,000 --> the important point about proper time is 01:40:08,000
01:40:08,000 --> it is the time which all observers no 01:40:11,000
01:40:11,000 --> matter what frame of reference therein 01:40:12,000
01:40:12,000 --> can agree on 01:40:14,000
01:40:14,000 --> so if we use tau we know that there can 01:40:17,000
01:40:17,000 --> be no arguments about what we mean so 01:40:19,000
01:40:19,000 --> we're looking about the rate of change 01:40:21,000
01:40:21,000 --> of distance with time and that's called 01:40:25,000
01:40:25,000 --> a tangent vector and what we want to say 01:40:27,000
01:40:27,000 --> is that the derivative of that tangent 01:40:30,000
01:40:30,000 --> vector must equal zero in order to find 01:40:34,000
01:40:34,000 --> the minimum distance so generally 01:40:38,000
01:40:38,000 --> speaking if you want to find the minimum 01:40:40,000
01:40:40,000 --> in a curve you take the derivative you 01:40:42,000
01:40:42,000 --> take thee and you set that derivative 01:40:44,000
01:40:44,000 --> equal to zero and that will give you the 01:40:46,000
01:40:46,000 --> minimum it also gives you incidentally 01:40:48,000
01:40:48,000 --> the maximum but in this case we're 01:40:50,000
01:40:50,000 --> talking about the minimum so if you take 01:40:54,000
01:40:54,000 --> the derivative of the tangent vector and 01:40:56,000
01:40:56,000 --> set it to zero you will get as it were 01:40:59,000
01:40:59,000 --> the path for the geodesic the shortest 01:41:03,000
01:41:03,000 --> distance now when I say take the 01:41:06,000
01:41:06,000 --> derivative remember we must always be 01:41:08,000
01:41:08,000 --> cautious about derivatives in in general 01:41:10,000
01:41:10,000 --> relativity we've already learned that 01:41:13,000
01:41:13,000 --> can come a cropper if we take ordinary 01:41:14,000
01:41:14,000 --> derivatives we need to go for the 01:41:16,000
01:41:16,000 --> covariant derivative so let's take the 01:41:20,000
01:41:20,000 --> covariant derivative of this tangent 01:41:22,000
01:41:22,000 --> vector DX mu by D tau and from Equation 01:41:28,000
01:41:28,000 --> 7 which should be on the screen you can 01:41:31,000
01:41:31,000 --> see that that will essentially be the 01:41:33,000
01:41:33,000 --> ordinary derivative plus a gamma term 01:41:41,000
01:41:41,000 --> which I won't fill out but there is a 01:41:44,000
01:41:44,000 --> gamma term remember that's the 01:41:46,000
01:41:46,000 --> correcting term and what we can say is 01:41:49,000
01:41:49,000 --> for the geodesic this term must equal 01:41:52,000
01:41:52,000 --> zero so you've got this term Plus this 01:41:59,000
01:41:59,000 --> term equals zero let's look at this term 01:42:03,000
01:42:03,000 --> here this is essentially a double 01:42:06,000
01:42:06,000 --> differential with respect to time it is 01:42:09,000
01:42:09,000 --> if you like D to X mu D tau squared what 01:42:19,000
01:42:19,000 --> does that look like 01:42:20,000
01:42:20,000 --> isn't that acceleration the rate of 01:42:24,000
01:42:24,000 --> change of the rate of change of distance 01:42:27,000
01:42:27,000 --> with time D to X by DT squared is 01:42:30,000
01:42:30,000 --> acceleration and that equals well if 01:42:34,000
01:42:34,000 --> that Plus that equals naught this equals 01:42:37,000
01:42:37,000 --> minus the gamma term well what does that 01:42:42,000
01:42:42,000 --> look like let's remember that general 01:42:46,000
01:42:46,000 --> relativity and Newton's law of 01:42:49,000
01:42:49,000 --> gravitation need to be the same when 01:42:53,000
01:42:53,000 --> you're just talking about ordinary 01:42:55,000
01:42:55,000 --> masses ordinary speeds low speeds 01:42:59,000
01:42:59,000 --> you're not talking a black about black 01:43:01,000
01:43:01,000 --> holes because Newton's law of 01:43:03,000
01:43:03,000 --> gravitation very nicely describes what 01:43:07,000
01:43:07,000 --> appears to be gravity and so in the 01:43:10,000
01:43:10,000 --> simple case general relativity and 01:43:13,000
01:43:13,000 --> Newton's law must conform to the same 01:43:17,000
01:43:17,000 --> thing Newton's law says that force is 01:43:20,000
01:43:20,000 --> mass times acceleration or if you like 01:43:24,000
01:43:24,000 --> that acceleration 01:43:26,000
01:43:26,000 --> is a force term divided by mass and here 01:43:31,000
01:43:31,000 --> we've got an acceleration is equal to 01:43:34,000
01:43:34,000 --> minus a gamma term so what we can say is 01:43:38,000
01:43:38,000 --> that that gamma term is the equivalent 01:43:42,000
01:43:42,000 --> of force in Newton's laws and there'll 01:43:48,000
01:43:48,000 --> be a mass term in it as well but mass is 01:43:50,000
01:43:50,000 --> constant so let's forget about that this 01:43:52,000
01:43:52,000 --> gamma term this Christoffel symbol has a 01:43:55,000
01:43:55,000 --> kind of broad equivalence to force now 01:43:58,000
01:43:58,000 --> to save time I just rewritten equation 01:44:02,000
01:44:02,000 --> nine that we derived for the Christoffel 01:44:04,000
01:44:04,000 --> symbol remember we said that it consists 01:44:07,000
01:44:07,000 --> of metric tensor plus derivatives of the 01:44:11,000
01:44:11,000 --> metric tensor now let's consider a 01:44:14,000
01:44:14,000 --> situation where we're talking about low 01:44:17,000
01:44:17,000 --> gravity low speed we're not in black 01:44:19,000
01:44:19,000 --> holes we're not anything like that is 01:44:21,000
01:44:21,000 --> just ordinary space slow movement 01:44:24,000
01:44:24,000 --> general relativity must reduce to no to 01:44:28,000
01:44:28,000 --> Newtonian gravity when that happens G 01:44:33,000
01:44:33,000 --> becomes 1 and the derivative terms are 01:44:39,000
01:44:39,000 --> very very small with one exception and 01:44:43,000
01:44:43,000 --> that is the time term and time remember 01:44:48,000
01:44:48,000 --> has mu and nu equal to 0 so the DG 0 0 0 01:44:55,000
01:44:55,000 --> by DX time component is the only term in 01:45:00,000
01:45:00,000 --> the derivatives that has any 01:45:02,000
01:45:02,000 --> significance all the rest when you're 01:45:05,000
01:45:05,000 --> talking about slow speed small masses no 01:45:08,000
01:45:08,000 --> black holes all these other terms are 01:45:10,000
01:45:10,000 --> very very small the only one that has 01:45:13,000
01:45:13,000 --> any significance is the time term and 01:45:15,000
01:45:15,000 --> this term G becomes 1 and so that gamma 01:45:20,000
01:45:20,000 --> term reduces to 1/2 that G becomes 1 so 01:45:25,000
01:45:25,000 --> we can ignore that multiplied by all of 01:45:28,000
01:45:28,000 --> this lot which is simply DG 0 0 0 by DX 01:45:34,000
01:45:34,000 --> and that we said was 01:45:38,000
01:45:38,000 --> equivalent to a force term so the force 01:45:41,000
01:45:41,000 --> is kind of equivalent to this term here 01:45:44,000
01:45:44,000 --> but in Newtonian mechanics force is 01:45:48,000
01:45:48,000 --> minus the derivative of the potential 01:45:54,000
01:45:54,000 --> for example if the potential energy near 01:45:58,000
01:45:58,000 --> the earth is equal to mg X where X is 01:46:02,000
01:46:02,000 --> the height above the earth then the 01:46:05,000
01:46:05,000 --> force it will usually be given as minus 01:46:08,000
01:46:08,000 --> mg X of course then the force will be 01:46:11,000
01:46:11,000 --> minus D Phi by the X which equals minus 01:46:16,000
01:46:16,000 --> mg the minus term simply indicates that 01:46:21,000
01:46:21,000 --> the force is acting in one direction 01:46:23,000
01:46:23,000 --> that X is measured in the other 01:46:25,000
01:46:25,000 --> direction 01:46:25,000
01:46:25,000 --> so all I'm showing here is that in 01:46:28,000
01:46:28,000 --> Newtonian mechanics force is minus the 01:46:32,000
01:46:32,000 --> derivative of the potential now we just 01:46:36,000
01:46:36,000 --> show that the Christoffel symbol capital 01:46:39,000
01:46:39,000 --> gamma is the equivalent of a force term 01:46:43,000
01:46:43,000 --> and in ordinary space where we're not 01:46:47,000
01:46:47,000 --> anywhere near black holes that it 01:46:50,000
01:46:50,000 --> equalled the derivative of the time 01:46:52,000
01:46:52,000 --> component of the metric tensor with 01:46:54,000
01:46:54,000 --> respect to X and we've also just shown 01:46:57,000
01:46:57,000 --> that force is minus the potential or the 01:47:04,000
01:47:04,000 --> derivative of the potential with respect 01:47:06,000
01:47:06,000 --> to X and so we can see that if gamma is 01:47:10,000
01:47:10,000 --> a force term that these two terms are 01:47:14,000
01:47:14,000 --> broadly equivalent and thus you get that 01:47:18,000
01:47:18,000 --> G naught naught is equal to 2 Phi plus a 01:47:24,000
01:47:24,000 --> constant from the integration that you 01:47:27,000
01:47:27,000 --> need to do but you can forget all about 01:47:28,000
01:47:28,000 --> the constant because as soon as we 01:47:30,000
01:47:30,000 --> differentiate again that constant will 01:47:32,000
01:47:32,000 --> go there is probably a minus sign in 01:47:35,000
01:47:35,000 --> there somewhere but we don't need to 01:47:37,000
01:47:37,000 --> worry too much about that either we're 01:47:38,000
01:47:38,000 --> looking at the principle here what we're 01:47:40,000
01:47:40,000 --> saying is that because the Christoffel 01:47:42,000
01:47:42,000 --> symbol equals that and Christoffel 01:47:45,000
01:47:45,000 --> symbol has a kind of force equivalence 01:47:47,000
01:47:47,000 --> and in Newtonian mechanics force is 01:47:50,000
01:47:50,000 --> equal to minus that if 01:47:52,000
01:47:52,000 --> Rachele of the potential energy that you 01:47:55,000
01:47:55,000 --> can therefore equate these two terms and 01:47:57,000
01:47:57,000 --> if you equate those two terms 01:47:59,000
01:47:59,000 --> essentially the metric tensor or the 01:48:02,000
01:48:02,000 --> time value of the metric tensor is equal 01:48:06,000
01:48:06,000 --> to two times the potential energy plus a 01:48:09,000
01:48:09,000 --> constant now we said that force is minus 01:48:14,000
01:48:14,000 --> D Phi sorry is minus D Phi by DX but of 01:48:17,000
01:48:17,000 --> course we really need to do that in 01:48:19,000
01:48:19,000 --> three dimensions and so that normally 01:48:22,000
01:48:22,000 --> reduces to what is called the divergence 01:48:25,000
01:48:25,000 --> of Phi where the divergence term is 01:48:29,000
01:48:29,000 --> simply a D by DX plus a D by dy plus a D 01:48:35,000
01:48:35,000 --> by DZ D term and that of course should 01:48:41,000
01:48:41,000 --> be minus there but we also know from 01:48:45,000
01:48:45,000 --> Newton's law of gravitation that the 01:48:47,000
01:48:47,000 --> force is equal to minus G the 01:48:50,000
01:48:50,000 --> gravitational constant times the mass of 01:48:53,000
01:48:53,000 --> one object times the mass of the object 01:48:55,000
01:48:55,000 --> other object divided by the square of 01:48:57,000
01:48:57,000 --> the distance between them so let's 01:49:02,000
01:49:02,000 --> consider an object of mass M and let's 01:49:07,000
01:49:07,000 --> consider a distance R from mass M and we 01:49:13,000
01:49:13,000 --> ask ourselves the question what is the 01:49:15,000
01:49:15,000 --> force acting on a unit mass place a 01:49:19,000
01:49:19,000 --> distance R from M well if the unit mass 01:49:23,000
01:49:23,000 --> that means the unit mass is 1 the force 01:49:26,000
01:49:26,000 --> will be minus G M over R squared because 01:49:32,000
01:49:32,000 --> M is 1 what is therefore the force 01:49:35,000
01:49:35,000 --> capability across the whole of that 01:49:39,000
01:49:39,000 --> surface of that sphere well that's going 01:49:44,000
01:49:44,000 --> to be the integral of F da where da is 01:49:48,000
01:49:48,000 --> the area of the surface of the sphere 01:49:52,000
01:49:52,000 --> and that's going to be the integral of 01:49:56,000
01:49:56,000 --> the force which is minus GM over R 01:50:00,000
01:50:00,000 --> squared times da 01:50:04,000
01:50:04,000 --> well if you integrate out that of course 01:50:07,000
01:50:07,000 --> is simply going to be equal to minus GM 01:50:09,000
01:50:09,000 --> over R squared times times the entire 01:50:14,000
01:50:14,000 --> area of the surface of that sphere of 01:50:17,000
01:50:17,000 --> radius R which is 4 PI R squared the R 01:50:22,000
01:50:22,000 --> Squared's cancel and so you find that 01:50:25,000
01:50:25,000 --> that reduces to minus GM times 4 pi now 01:50:31,000
01:50:31,000 --> there is a theorem called the divergence 01:50:33,000
01:50:33,000 --> theorem which I won't derive but you can 01:50:36,000
01:50:36,000 --> look it up I'll write it out first 01:50:38,000
01:50:38,000 --> it says that the integral of F Da over 01:50:41,000
01:50:41,000 --> an area is equal to the integral over 01:50:45,000
01:50:45,000 --> the volume of Dell F DV and what that 01:50:51,000
01:50:51,000 --> means in layman's terms is that the 01:50:54,000
01:50:54,000 --> outward flux through the area of a 01:50:57,000
01:50:57,000 --> sphere is equal to the volume integral 01:51:00,000
01:51:00,000 --> of the divergence of the force that's 01:51:04,000
01:51:04,000 --> just a divergence theorem that can be 01:51:06,000
01:51:06,000 --> derived and you can look it up I also 01:51:09,000
01:51:09,000 --> just want to remind you that density is 01:51:11,000
01:51:11,000 --> mass divided by volume and that 01:51:15,000
01:51:15,000 --> therefore you can say that the mass of 01:51:17,000
01:51:17,000 --> an object will be the integral of the 01:51:19,000
01:51:19,000 --> density with respect to volume so now 01:51:24,000
01:51:24,000 --> I'm going to take F da which we 01:51:28,000
01:51:28,000 --> calculated to be this term and set it 01:51:30,000
01:51:30,000 --> equal to this term so you've now got 01:51:33,000
01:51:33,000 --> that F dot Da is four pi G times M or 01:51:38,000
01:51:38,000 --> more accurately minus four PI G times M 01:51:44,000
01:51:44,000 --> but for M I'm going to use the integral 01:51:47,000
01:51:47,000 --> of Rho DV density times volume 01:51:52,000
01:51:52,000 --> that's F da or more accurately this the 01:51:58,000
01:51:58,000 --> integral of F dot Da 01:52:00,000
01:52:00,000 --> and that's going to be the integral of 01:52:02,000
01:52:02,000 --> the volume of DF DV or del F DV the 01:52:09,000
01:52:09,000 --> divergence of F well although it's not 01:52:14,000
01:52:14,000 --> really proper to do it you can cancel 01:52:16,000
01:52:16,000 --> out the D V's 01:52:17,000
01:52:17,000 --> essentially what you're left with is 01:52:19,000
01:52:19,000 --> that del F the divergence of F is equal 01:52:25,000
01:52:25,000 --> to four PI G Rev actually minus four PI 01:52:31,000
01:52:31,000 --> G unfortunately I had a camera failure 01:52:33,000
01:52:33,000 --> for the next section so I'm just 01:52:35,000
01:52:35,000 --> repeating the flow of the argument we've 01:52:38,000
01:52:38,000 --> shown that the force is minus the 01:52:40,000
01:52:40,000 --> derivative of the potential in Newtonian 01:52:43,000
01:52:43,000 --> mechanics we've also just shown that the 01:52:47,000
01:52:47,000 --> derivative of the force is equal to 01:52:50,000
01:52:50,000 --> minus four PI G low consequently if the 01:52:55,000
01:52:55,000 --> force is minus the derivative of Phi the 01:53:00,000
01:53:00,000 --> derivative of force is the derivative of 01:53:03,000
01:53:03,000 --> minus the derivative of Phi and that 01:53:06,000
01:53:06,000 --> equals minus four PI G Rho in other 01:53:10,000
01:53:10,000 --> words minus the derivative squared of 01:53:14,000
01:53:14,000 --> Phi B potential equals four PI G Rho the 01:53:19,000
01:53:19,000 --> minuses on both sides cancel earlier we 01:53:25,000
01:53:25,000 --> showed that the time component of the 01:53:29,000
01:53:29,000 --> metric tensor G zero zero equals twice 01:53:33,000
01:53:33,000 --> the potential plus a constant which 01:53:37,000
01:53:37,000 --> means that the potential is 1/2 the 01:53:41,000
01:53:41,000 --> metric tensor I've dropped the constant 01:53:44,000
01:53:44,000 --> that you'll see there's no problem 01:53:45,000
01:53:45,000 --> without doing so because as soon as you 01:53:47,000
01:53:47,000 --> do do a derivative of Phi derivative 01:53:52,000
01:53:52,000 --> squared of Phi which is this term here 01:53:58,000
01:53:58,000 --> replacing Phi by 1/2 G zero zero the 01:54:02,000
01:54:02,000 --> constants will all go of course so now 01:54:05,000
01:54:05,000 --> you've got that the derivative squared 01:54:07,000
01:54:07,000 --> of Phi is four PI G Rho so the 01:54:10,000
01:54:10,000 --> derivative squared of half the time 01:54:13,000
01:54:13,000 --> component the metric tensor equals four 01:54:16,000
01:54:16,000 --> PI G Rho and if you multiply both sides 01:54:20,000
01:54:20,000 --> of the equation by two you get that the 01:54:26,000
01:54:26,000 --> derivative squared of the metric tensor 01:54:29,000
01:54:29,000 --> equals eight pi 01:54:31,000
01:54:31,000 --> gee ro the problem with that is it's not 01:54:35,000
01:54:35,000 --> a tensor equation and for general 01:54:39,000
01:54:39,000 --> relativity we need tensor equations so 01:54:42,000
01:54:42,000 --> what we're looking for is something that 01:54:45,000
01:54:45,000 --> looks similar to it but we're on the 01:54:48,000
01:54:48,000 --> left hand side of the equation you've 01:54:49,000
01:54:49,000 --> got a tensor and on the right-hand side 01:54:53,000
01:54:53,000 --> of the equation you've got tensor so we 01:54:55,000
01:54:55,000 --> want something that has the form of G mu 01:54:58,000
01:54:58,000 --> nu which is actually called Einsteins 01:55:00,000
01:55:00,000 --> tensor is equal to 8 pi G but instead of 01:55:05,000
01:55:05,000 --> having the mass density term Rho we want 01:55:09,000
01:55:09,000 --> a tensor for energy something that 01:55:13,000
01:55:13,000 --> contains all the mass energy stress 01:55:16,000
01:55:16,000 --> pressure terms that you can have so 01:55:19,000
01:55:19,000 --> we've essentially got to find something 01:55:21,000
01:55:21,000 --> for this and something for that let's 01:55:23,000
01:55:23,000 --> look at the T mu nu side of it first if 01:55:27,000
01:55:27,000 --> you go back to my video on special 01:55:30,000
01:55:30,000 --> relativity e equals mc-squared 01:55:32,000
01:55:32,000 --> part 5 and go to the point in the video 01:55:35,000
01:55:35,000 --> which is 2 minutes and 10 seconds in 01:55:38,000
01:55:38,000 --> you'll find that we derive what is 01:55:40,000
01:55:40,000 --> called a momentum four-vector the four 01:55:44,000
01:55:44,000 --> vectors of course one dimension of time 01:55:47,000
01:55:47,000 --> three dimensions of space and you'll 01:55:50,000
01:55:50,000 --> find that we defined that momentum 01:55:52,000
01:55:52,000 --> four-vector as being mass multiplied by 01:55:55,000
01:55:55,000 --> X naught over tau X 1 over tau X 2 over 01:56:02,000
01:56:02,000 --> tau and X 3 over tau and this is simply 01:56:07,000
01:56:07,000 --> obviously that's the time component the 01:56:09,000
01:56:09,000 --> X component the Y component and the Z 01:56:12,000
01:56:12,000 --> component in the four dimensions of 01:56:15,000
01:56:15,000 --> space-time divided by tau the proper 01:56:18,000
01:56:18,000 --> time the time that everybody agrees and 01:56:21,000
01:56:21,000 --> what we showed was that if you reduce 01:56:24,000
01:56:24,000 --> this term you get essentially an MC 01:56:27,000
01:56:27,000 --> squared which is energy e equals MC 01:56:31,000
01:56:31,000 --> squared and these terms all effectively 01:56:35,000
01:56:35,000 --> become the momentum in the different 01:56:40,000
01:56:40,000 --> coordinates 01:56:42,000
01:56:42,000 --> so it's MV in the x-direction MV in the 01:56:45,000
01:56:45,000 --> y-direction and MV in the same direction 01:56:48,000
01:56:48,000 --> so this for momentum reduces out to 01:56:52,000
01:56:52,000 --> basic rest mass energy plus momenta in 01:56:56,000
01:56:56,000 --> the three coordinates of space well 01:57:00,000
01:57:00,000 --> that's fine but that is just of course 01:57:02,000
01:57:02,000 --> essentially a vector we need a tensor we 01:57:07,000
01:57:07,000 --> need not P that T mu nu and that means 01:57:12,000
01:57:12,000 --> we need a four by four matrix and to 01:57:16,000
01:57:16,000 --> save time I've drawn one and there it is 01:57:19,000
01:57:19,000 --> you will see that T has all the values 01:57:22,000
01:57:22,000 --> of mu and nu from naught to 3 and what 01:57:27,000
01:57:27,000 --> do all these values mean well the top 01:57:30,000
01:57:30,000 --> one T naught naught that is going to be 01:57:32,000
01:57:32,000 --> the time component of the of the of the 01:57:37,000
01:57:37,000 --> energy stress energy momentum tensor and 01:57:39,000
01:57:39,000 --> that has this kind of equivalence it's 01:57:42,000
01:57:42,000 --> the energy part of the tensor the three 01:57:48,000
01:57:48,000 --> components along the top here I want to 01:57:50,000
01:57:50,000 --> call the energy flow parts of the tensor 01:57:53,000
01:57:53,000 --> the three components here I want to call 01:57:57,000
01:57:57,000 --> the momentum density of the tensor and 01:58:00,000
01:58:00,000 --> the nine components which are left are 01:58:03,000
01:58:03,000 --> essentially the momentum flux stress 01:58:07,000
01:58:07,000 --> pressure parts of the tensor now those 01:58:09,000
01:58:09,000 --> we are embodying every part of energy 01:58:13,000
01:58:13,000 --> that we can think of whether it be pure 01:58:15,000
01:58:15,000 --> energy rest mass energy momentum stress 01:58:18,000
01:58:18,000 --> all of it somehow finds a place in this 01:58:22,000
01:58:22,000 --> stress energy momentum tensor it is if 01:58:27,000
01:58:27,000 --> you like a measure of energy per unit 01:58:30,000
01:58:30,000 --> volume now energy has the same units as 01:58:35,000
01:58:35,000 --> work so we can think of this as work per 01:58:37,000
01:58:37,000 --> unit volume work is Force Times distance 01:58:41,000
01:58:41,000 --> distance is a length volume is a length 01:58:45,000
01:58:45,000 --> cubed so that's equivalent force divided 01:58:48,000
01:58:48,000 --> by a length squared which is force over 01:58:51,000
01:58:51,000 --> area which is of course the units of 01:58:54,000
01:58:54,000 --> pressure 01:58:55,000
01:58:55,000 --> so that's how energy per unit volume can 01:58:58,000
01:58:58,000 --> also embrace pressure or stress so 01:59:03,000
01:59:03,000 --> that's given us we can't derive it but 01:59:06,000
01:59:06,000 --> I'm trying to illustrate how we get here 01:59:08,000
01:59:08,000 --> that's given us a stress energy momentum 01:59:11,000
01:59:11,000 --> tensor with 16 different terms some of 01:59:16,000
01:59:16,000 --> which it turns out are duplicates it 01:59:18,000
01:59:18,000 --> comes in the form of a matrix it 01:59:21,000
01:59:21,000 --> embodies all forms of energy and it's 01:59:25,000
01:59:25,000 --> the stress energy momentum tensor that 01:59:27,000
01:59:27,000 --> we use on the right-hand side of the 01:59:29,000
01:59:29,000 --> Einstein field equation so now we've got 01:59:33,000
01:59:33,000 --> on the right-hand side we've got the 8 01:59:36,000
01:59:36,000 --> pi G that we derived but we're going to 01:59:39,000
01:59:39,000 --> replace the density term that we came up 01:59:42,000
01:59:42,000 --> with with this new stress energy 01:59:45,000
01:59:45,000 --> momentum tensor and we're going to have 01:59:49,000
01:59:49,000 --> something on the left-hand side now what 01:59:51,000
01:59:51,000 --> could it be this is as it were the mass 01:59:54,000
01:59:54,000 --> term on this side we need something that 01:59:57,000
01:59:57,000 --> is the space-time curvature term so02:00:00,000
02:00:00,000 --> Einstein thought that the obvious 02:00:02,000
02:00:02,000 --> candidate for it would be the Ricci 02:00:04,000
02:00:04,000 --> curvature tensor ah mutant ooh but 02:00:09,000
02:00:09,000 --> there's a problem the problem is that we 02:00:13,000
02:00:13,000 --> have a thing called energy conservation 02:00:15,000
02:00:15,000 --> energy can be neither created nor 02:00:17,000
02:00:17,000 --> destroyed so if you take the derivative 02:00:20,000
02:00:20,000 --> of the energy tensor it should be zero 02:00:25,000
02:00:25,000 --> there is no change in energy the problem 02:00:31,000
02:00:31,000 --> is if you take the derivative of the 02:00:34,000
02:00:34,000 --> Ricci tensor it does not equal zero so 02:00:39,000
02:00:39,000 --> that equation can't be true because the 02:00:42,000
02:00:42,000 --> derivative one side would be zero the 02:00:45,000
02:00:45,000 --> derivative of the other side would not a 02:00:47,000
02:00:47,000 --> bear in mind that we must always when 02:00:51,000
02:00:51,000 --> we're talking about general relativity 02:00:53,000
02:00:53,000 --> and field equations never do ordinary 02:00:56,000
02:00:56,000 --> derivatives you will come unstuck we 02:00:59,000
02:00:59,000 --> must always use the covariant derivative 02:01:01,000
02:01:01,000 --> so if we've got that the covariant 02:01:03,000
02:01:03,000 --> derivative of the energy side is zero 02:01:08,000
02:01:08,000 --> we need something on the left-hand side 02:01:10,000
02:01:10,000 --> whose derivative will equal zero 02:01:14,000
02:01:14,000 --> now what Einstein actually found was 02:01:16,000
02:01:16,000 --> that the covariant derivative of the 02:01:20,000
02:01:20,000 --> Ricci tensor was not zero but it 02:01:24,000
02:01:24,000 --> actually was one half times the 02:01:26,000
02:01:26,000 --> covariant derivative of the metric 02:01:30,000
02:01:30,000 --> tensor times the curvature scalar which 02:01:34,000
02:01:34,000 --> we spoke about earlier have you got an 02:01:38,000
02:01:38,000 --> equation like that you can bring 02:01:40,000
02:01:40,000 --> everything to one side and essentially 02:01:43,000
02:01:43,000 --> you get that the covariant derivative of 02:01:46,000
02:01:46,000 --> the Ricci tensor minus half times the 02:01:51,000
02:01:51,000 --> metric tensor times the curvature scalar 02:01:54,000
02:01:54,000 --> equals zero and now we've got a 02:01:58,000
02:01:58,000 --> covariant derivative of the term which 02:02:01,000
02:02:01,000 --> equals zero we've got the covariant 02:02:05,000
02:02:05,000 --> derivative of t MV equals zero and the 02:02:09,000
02:02:09,000 --> covariant derivative of this term equals 02:02:11,000
02:02:11,000 --> zero therefore that term and that term 02:02:14,000
02:02:14,000 --> must be equivalent and so we've now got 02:02:18,000
02:02:18,000 --> a left-hand side of the equation R mu nu 02:02:23,000
02:02:23,000 --> minus 1/2 G mu nu times R equals the 02:02:29,000
02:02:29,000 --> right-hand side of the equation when 02:02:30,000
02:02:30,000 --> it's not just team you knew of course 02:02:32,000
02:02:32,000 --> it's 8 pi G T mu nu and we're almost 02:02:42,000
02:02:42,000 --> there 02:02:42,000
02:02:42,000 --> it turns out four dimensional purposes 02:02:44,000
02:02:44,000 --> you need to have a C to the fourth term 02:02:47,000
02:02:47,000 --> here but that's essentially just a 02:02:50,000
02:02:50,000 --> constant for dimensional purposes but 02:02:53,000
02:02:53,000 --> Einstein realized he'd forgotten 02:02:55,000
02:02:55,000 --> something 02:02:56,000
02:02:56,000 --> you remember that earlier we showed that 02:02:57,000
02:02:57,000 --> the covariant derivative of the metric 02:03:01,000
02:03:01,000 --> tensor equals zero because it did it in 02:03:05,000
02:03:05,000 --> one frame and therefore it must do it in 02:03:07,000
02:03:07,000 --> all frames and therefore we could have 02:03:10,000
02:03:10,000 --> included the we could have included the 02:03:14,000
02:03:14,000 --> metric tensor in this equation here not 02:03:17,000
02:03:17,000 --> just as a multiplier of R but in its own 02:03:20,000
02:03:20,000 --> right 02:03:21,000
02:03:21,000 --> and of course we could have included it 02:03:23,000
02:03:23,000 --> with any constant in front of it so 02:03:26,000
02:03:26,000 --> Einstein therefore decided that you 02:03:30,000
02:03:30,000 --> needed to include this term in this 02:03:33,000
02:03:33,000 --> equation again so now you need armed you 02:03:37,000
02:03:37,000 --> knew minus 1/2 G mu nu R which is this 02:03:43,000
02:03:43,000 --> just system here and now you need to 02:03:46,000
02:03:46,000 --> include the fact that you could have had 02:03:48,000
02:03:48,000 --> a metric tensor term in here so we'll 02:03:51,000
02:03:51,000 --> add it and we will have a constant which 02:03:55,000
02:03:55,000 --> we'll call capital lambda multiplied by 02:04:01,000
02:04:01,000 --> the metric tensor and that equals 8 pi G 02:04:06,000
02:04:06,000 --> T mu nu divided by C to the fourth this 02:04:12,000
02:04:12,000 --> part you'll remember was the Einstein 02:04:15,000
02:04:15,000 --> tensor G mu nu what is this capital 02:04:20,000
02:04:20,000 --> lambda term where it's called the 02:04:22,000
02:04:22,000 --> cosmological constant and curiously it 02:04:25,000
02:04:25,000 --> is the constant which Einstein first 02:04:28,000
02:04:28,000 --> thought of way back when he was trying 02:04:31,000
02:04:31,000 --> to identify how you could describe space 02:04:35,000
02:04:35,000 --> in mathematical terms now he was being 02:04:37,000
02:04:37,000 --> told at the time that space was fixed 02:04:40,000
02:04:40,000 --> and unchanging but nothing moved in 02:04:43,000
02:04:43,000 --> space if he looked at it over a huge 02:04:45,000
02:04:45,000 --> cosmological time and space frame 02:04:48,000
02:04:48,000 --> obviously the earth goes around the Sun 02:04:50,000
02:04:50,000 --> but generally speaking everything stays 02:04:53,000
02:04:53,000 --> as it is that's what people thought an 02:04:55,000
02:04:55,000 --> Einstein said well that can't be right 02:04:57,000
02:04:57,000 --> because gravity would tend to make all 02:04:59,000
02:04:59,000 --> the galaxies pull together and if I'm 02:05:02,000
02:05:02,000 --> being told that they are not pulling 02:05:04,000
02:05:04,000 --> together 02:05:05,000
02:05:05,000 --> there must be something which is 02:05:07,000
02:05:07,000 --> balancing gravity and pushing the 02:05:10,000
02:05:10,000 --> galaxies apart so that gravitational 02:05:12,000
02:05:12,000 --> attraction is being balanced by the 02:05:16,000
02:05:16,000 --> thing that's pushing them apart and he 02:05:18,000
02:05:18,000 --> found that you could reintroduce that 02:05:20,000
02:05:20,000 --> into his Einstein field equations as the 02:05:23,000
02:05:23,000 --> constant that you multiplied by the 02:05:25,000
02:05:25,000 --> metric tensor this term is a very very 02:05:29,000
02:05:29,000 --> small term and you will often find it 02:05:31,000
02:05:31,000 --> will be left out of the Einstein field 02:05:33,000
02:05:33,000 --> patience it only becomes relevant when 02:05:36,000
02:05:36,000 --> you're talking about major cosmological 02:05:39,000
02:05:39,000 --> scales and that's it 02:05:42,000
02:05:42,000 --> we have derived in sorts the Einstein 02:05:46,000
02:05:46,000 --> field equations just to remind you mu 02:05:49,000
02:05:49,000 --> and nu are of course the time and space 02:05:52,000
02:05:52,000 --> dimensions naught one two and three and 02:05:54,000
02:05:54,000 --> therefore there are sixteen equations 02:05:56,000
02:05:56,000 --> there but six of them are identical to 02:06:00,000
02:06:00,000 --> another six so it reduces to just ten if 02:06:02,000
02:06:02,000 --> you want more information I remind you 02:06:04,000
02:06:04,000 --> that Leonard Susskind professor Leonard 02:06:07,000
02:06:07,000 --> Susskind of Stanford University gave an 02:06:09,000
02:06:09,000 --> excellent series in 2008 and I gave you 02:06:12,000
02:06:12,000 --> the link to that at the beginning of 02:06:14,000
02:06:14,000 --> this video that's it we're done the 02:06:18,000
02:06:18,000 --> Einstein field equations for beginners
