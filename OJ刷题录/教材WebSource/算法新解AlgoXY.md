>purely functional data structure + pearls of functional algorithm design。新瓶装旧酒，亮点是和命令式实现的比较。parallel algorithm着墨太少，系统性不如CMU 15210 lecture notes，fp老炮可以略过此书>


就我自己阅读的观后感，可以说是这书作者很牛逼

AlgoXY is an open book about elementary  algorithms and data structures. This book doesn't only focus on  imperative (or procedural) approach, but also includes purely functional  algorithms and data structures.

The PDF version in English can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY/releases/download/v0.6180333/elementary-algorithms.pdf).

The book in Chinese was published.  [http://www.ituring.com.cn/book/1907](http://www.ituring.com.cn/book/1907)

[Errata and Exercise](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY/wiki/Preface) can be found in github WIKI.

Compared to the pdf, the published version contains many important corrections to the contents, equations, and figures.

The original version provides examples in Haskell, C/C++, Python, and Scheme. I started A new branch jvm to provide examples in Java and Scala.
