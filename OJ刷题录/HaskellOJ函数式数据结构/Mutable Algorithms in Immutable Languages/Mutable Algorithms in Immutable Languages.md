# Mutable Algorithms in Immutable Languages












https://github.com/tel/old-blog/tree/master/_posts
The “Mutable Algorithms in Immutable Languages” seriesPart 1 where we introduce the problem of mutable algorithms in immutable languages by exploring Union/Find.Part 2 where we find models of mutable memory which can be executed purely or impurely in Haskell.Part 3 where we fix a crucial bug in the pure implementation from part 2 by reflecting on the need for border control between “regions” of mutable memory and, finally, finally, introduce ST as the final solution.
