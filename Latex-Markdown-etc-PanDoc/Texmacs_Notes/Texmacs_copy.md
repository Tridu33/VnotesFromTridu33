# Texmacs
Thank you for using this program. Since this seems to be the first time that you are using it, you will find a few useful comments and suggestions below. This text only appears at the first time when you start TeXmacs. If you want to read it again, you can find it in the menu Help→About→First start.
Help. 
For help about how to use the editor, please look in the Help menu. At either one of the websites 
    http://www.texmacs.org    


http://www.gnu.org/software/texmacs
you will find more help. Notice that you can get updated help via Help→Online help.
Support. 
If you like the program, then you may subscribe yourself to one of the TeXmacs mailing lists: see 
    http://www.texmacs.org/Web/Support.html

Also, you should not hesitate to directly contact the authors at contact@texmacs.org for questions, suggestions or bugs.
Fonts. 
The TeXmacs program uses professional TeX fonts. When you launch the program for the first time, many of these fonts may have to be generated, which may significantly slow down the editor. Keep cool: each font needs only to be generated once. At 
    ftp://ftp.texmacs.org/pub/TeXmacs/Fonts.html
you may also find some instructions about how to download some pregenerated fonts.
